<p>The object of this Treatise is to supply a want
long felt in the Silver Trade, namely, a work of
reference from which workmen, apprentices, and
manufacturers, employing the material upon which
it treats, may find information which will be of
assistance to them in the performance of their
daily duties, and by which their operations may
be rendered more successful. The Author was led
to undertake the present work from having had
many opportunities, during his lengthened experience
in the art of silver-working, of observing the
difficulties and stumbling-blocks that are constantly
to be met with in the manifold branches of this
important trade, by those <i>practically</i> engaged in it,
and also by those persons who are desirous of acquiring
a <i>thorough</i> knowledge of the mechanical and
manipulative details belonging to it. To assist his
object, numerous illustrations have been prepared
for this Treatise, with the view of rendering the
various processes of the art more readily comprehensible,
and to save a lengthened or detailed
description of them.</p>

<p>The different modes of alloying and melting
silver; its solders; the preparation of imitation
alloys; methods of working; the prevention of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">» vi «</a></span>
waste; instructions for improving and finishing
the surface of the work, together with other useful
information and memoranda&mdash;all these have been
carefully collected and placed in order in the body
of the work.</p>

<p>The Author has endeavoured, throughout, to
present the contents (which he has with some little
difficulty and labour brought together) in as
practical and readable a form as is compatible
with accuracy and efficiency.</p>

<p>Since the publication of the first edition of this
work important changes have taken place in the
commercial value of silver, its present cost in the
best markets being sixpence per ounce lower than
it was when this volume first appeared in 1877.
This depreciation in value has, of course, necessitated
a thorough revision of the former prices of
the various alloys, solders, and other substances
mentioned throughout the work; and this has been
done in order to render it the more complete as a
work of general reference, conveying correct and
useful information to the reader. The Author
trusts that his endeavours in this direction will be
appreciated.</p>

<p class="caption2"><a name="PREFACE_TO_THE_FOURTH" id="PREFACE_TO_THE_FOURTH">PREFACE TO THE FOURTH
EDITION.</a></p>


<p>In issuing the present edition, a few introductory
remarks are necessary to explain that numerous
revisions have been made in Chapters VI. and VII.
(by means of the Tables referred to below) regarding
the cost prices of the different alloys, solders, etc.,
which I trust will increase the value of the book.</p>

<p>Through the repeal of the silver duty in the year
1890, a great impetus has been given to the Silver
industry of this country, and notwithstanding the
length of time that has elapsed since this book was
first published, a steady demand has continued for
its possession by workers in the precious metal
trades&mdash;a fact which is gratifying to the Author, not
only because a reprint is again called for, but as
showing that the work has held its position, and may
now justly claim to be a standard authority on the
subject of which it treats.</p>

<p>It has not been found necessary to interfere with
the general processes embodied in the book, as they
are practically the same as formerly; but as regards
the commercial value of silver, there is again a
considerable depreciation<a name="FNanchor_A_1" id="FNanchor_A_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_1" class="fnanchor">[A]</a> to record on the prices
prepared for the second edition in 1885, and it becomes
imperative that this depreciation should be
dealt with in this new edition, in order to bring the
work up to date.</p>

<p>The market price of silver has for many years
been of a very variable nature, almost each day&rsquo;s
prices showing a difference, so that it would be impossible
to provide the reader with an unvarying
fixed price per ounce. The best and most practical
thing to do under the circumstances, it seemed, was
to carefully revise the different cost prices of the
alloys and solders specified in Chapters VI. and VII.
and give them by way of approximate Tables, compiled
for each chapter separately. These two Tables
follow this Preface (making pp. ix. and x.) and will
serve as a ready reference for present workers in the
silver trades. Thus, by bringing the figures down to
date, the work may still retain its reliable character
as a practical guide to the silversmith&rsquo;s workshop.</p>

<p>In February 1921 silver was quoted at 34&frac12;<i>d.</i> to 36-1/8<i>d.</i>,
and it is therefore sufficient to note that the prices at
that date correspond approximately to those current
in 1907. It should be noted that the melting of
British gold and silver is prohibited, as well as their
export.</p>

<p>In reviewing the rise and progress of the silversmith&rsquo;s
beautiful and interesting art, in its relation
to the manufacture of articles of personal ornament
and luxury at home and abroad, we may observe
at the outset, that the material of which they are
composed differs widely in character from that
employed by the ordinary &ldquo;metalsmiths&rdquo; and the
manufacturer of &ldquo;electro-plated wares.&rdquo; Silver,
the material of which we are now treating, being a
precious metal and of considerable value, it is
essentially necessary that the most careful means
be exercised in dealing with it from the commencement&mdash;that
is, from the pure or fine state&mdash;and
also that the utmost economy be observed in
reference to the kind of mechanical treatment to
which it is subjected in the production of the
silversmith&rsquo;s work, in order to prevent too great
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">» 2 «</a></span>
a quantity of waste or loss of material. For it
should be borne in mind that silver, like gold,
begins to lose, in one way or another, every time
it is touched; therefore, carefulness and economy
will be the characteristics of our teaching, so far
as regards the present subject.</p>

<p>The vast majority of working silversmiths know
very little of the physical and chemical properties
of the metal they employ, and still less of the comparison
it bears with other metals in the field of
science; and this want of scientific knowledge is
nowhere more apparent than in our own country,
where the English workman, in art education, is
much behind the foreigner; and yet we have some
of the finest and best workmen, in their <i>special</i>
branches, in the whole world. The English workman
believes that if the work is worth doing at all,
it is worth doing well; and we have no hesitation
in saying, that, if a good technical education were
afforded, concerning the precious metal trades, he
would scarcely have an equal, and certainly no
superior, abroad, in art workmanship, both in
respect to the display of good taste and judgment,
combined with a knowledge of design, so
far as the exercise of these qualities is compatible
with the manufacture of articles specially designed
for use and ornament.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">» 3 «</a></span></p>

<p>The object of the information we are about to
supply is to enable the practical silversmith to
become a perfect master of his art or profession;
and such a condition, when once achieved, will be
found of considerable assistance to him in the
various kinds of manufacture that present themselves;
so that he will know how to begin a piece
of work and when to leave it off; be able to
remedy a defect in the metal when required, as
well as be in a position to form an opinion as
to the relative treatment of its different alloys; all
of which invariably require different treatment.</p>

<p>We shall commence by describing the characteristics
of <i>fine silver</i>, carefully narrating the distinctive
features of its alloys; then give an
account of the processes employed, mechanical
and chemical, in the silversmith&rsquo;s workshop; and
conclude by pointing out the difference between
English and foreign work in regard both to style
and workmanship.</p>

<p>It may be thought by the reader, if uninitiated
in the art, that the costly plate and other articles
made from the precious metal are manufactured
from entirely <i>pure</i> silver, and therefore that they
possess absolute freedom from alloy; but this is
not the case. Pure silver being far too soft to
stand the necessary wear and tear of (metallic)<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">» 4 «</a></span>
life, it is mixed with some other metal, to give
it increased hardness. In the manufacture of
plate and ornamental wares the metal employed
is always copper, in various proportions, thus
forming different commercial qualities; and of
these we shall speak hereafter. Our first object
is to treat of the chemical and physical properties
of the pure metal.</p>

<p class="caption3">Silver.</p>


<p>Pure silver is, next to gold, the finest metal, but
of a smoother and more polished nature. It may
be said to be almost infinitely malleable, but it
will not so easily yield or extend under the
hammer as fine gold. As a malleable metal,
however, it stands next to it in this respect. It
is characterized by its perfectly white colour, being
the whitest of all the metals. It is harder than
gold, yet in a pure state it is so soft that it can
easily be cut with a knife. On account of its
extreme softness, when in a pure state, it is employed
for filigree work, being utterly devoid of
that elastic power which is found in the metal
when alloyed. It is for this reason that the Indian
filigree workers, who are the finest in the world, are
so very particular about the absolute purity of the
metal before commencing the manufacture of their
artistic work; all of which is exceedingly beautiful.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">» 6 «</a></span></p>

<p>It is reported that fine silver is capable of being
beaten into leaves of less than one-hundred-thousandth
part of an inch in thickness. For the
accuracy of this statement we cannot vouch, never
having had occasion to try the experiment; its
employment in that form being unknown in the
ordinary industrial pursuits. Fine silver is extremely
ductile, and may be drawn into the very
finest wire without breaking, and almost without
annealing. Its purity can be partly ascertained by
the latter process; for perfectly fine silver never
changes colour by heat, whereas when it contains
alloy it blackens if heated in contact with a
current of air, and soon hardens in wire-drawing.</p>

<p>Silver was a metallic element known to the
ancients, and it is repeatedly mentioned in the
Holy Scriptures. In the time of the patriarchs we
read of it as having been constantly employed in
the transactions of nations, and that it was in use
as a standard of value; thus forming a circulating
medium for the purpose of exchange. This function
it has always continued to fulfil down to the
present day, except that since the year 1816 it has
not been so employed in the English currency.
However, as token money, it is everywhere recognised
as a circulating medium of trade. The
Egyptian symbol for silver was represented by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">» 7 «</a></span>
<a href="#fig_1">Fig. 1</a>, relating to the moon; in modern chemistry
it is understood by <i>ag.</i> from the Latin name <i>argentum</i>,
denoting silver.</p>

<p>Fine silver is capable of receiving a polish
scarcely inferior in lustre to that of highly
polished steel, and in this state it
reflects more light and heat than any
other metal, without any perceptible
change of colour for some considerable
time. It is chiefly on this account,
as well as its resistance to oxidation
in air and water, that it is used for such a variety
of purposes, not only of ornament and luxury,
but also in a domestic way. Silver, unlike gold,
cannot resist the influence of sulphuretted hydrogen,
from the action of which it very soon becomes
much tarnished if left exposed in damp rooms, &amp;c.</p>

<p>Silver ranks next to gold in point of ductility
and malleability. When pure, its density, or specific
gravity, lies between 10.47 and 10.50, taking
water as 1, according to the degree of compression
it has received by rolling and hammering. It is
fusible at a full red heat, or about 1873&deg; Fahr. It
is a metal having a very low radiating power for
heat; hence silver wire of given dimensions retains
and conducts heat better than a similar piece of
another metal; for the same reason, a liquid contained
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">» 8 «</a></span>
in a silver vessel retains its heat much longer
than if placed in one made of some other substance.
Silver volatilises when subjected to a very great
temperature in the fire, emitting rather greenish
fumes. It loses between 2/21sts and 3/25ths, in proportion
to its impurity, of its absolute weight in air
when weighed in water. In point of tenacity it
occupies the fifth position among the useful metals.
In hardness it lies between copper and gold; and
a small addition of the former substance considerably
increases this quality, in which state it is
largely employed in the arts. Nitric acid is the
proper solvent for silver, as it dissolves it with the
greatest ease and rapidity, forming <i>nitrate</i> of silver,
which is much used for medical purposes, and in
art. Sulphuric and hydrochloric acids act upon it
but slowly in the cold. Silver resists partially the
best aqua-regia, probably on account of the dense
chloride which forms on the surface of the metal,
from the action of the hydrochloric acid in the
mixture of aqua-regia.</p>

<p>Fine silver is largely used in the industrial and
commercial arts, in the manufacture of silver lace
and fine filigree work; the latter branch being
more commonly practised in India, Sweden, Norway,
and some parts of Germany, where labour is
cheap, than in England. This class of silversmith&rsquo;s
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">» 9 «</a></span>
work takes a long time to produce, and as
labour forms the chief item of its cost, this, not
unnaturally, acts as a great drawback in the extension
of the art of very fine filigree working, in all
its intricate variety, in countries where labour is
dear. To this subject we shall subsequently refer
again in detail. Fine silver, with a small proportion
of alloy, is largely used by all nations
for purposes of coinage. It amalgamates with
nearly all the metals, but is principally used in
alloys suitable to the watchmaker&rsquo;s and silversmith&rsquo;s
art. The purchasable price of fine silver for
manufacturing purposes, which in 1884 was 4<i>s.</i> 8<i>d.</i>
is now, 1921, 3<i>s.</i> per ounce, troy weight, varying
however in value according to the total amounts
purchased; for which see refiners' and assayers'
charge lists, to be procured at the offices of any
bullion dealer. The silver ores of commerce have
generally an intermixture of a small quantity of
gold, and sometimes instances have occurred in
which it has been employed in manufactures without
a proper chemical investigation; and in such
cases the loss resulting from the omission would
have amply paid the expenses of the process.</p>

<p>Exposed to the action of hot and concentrated sulphuric
acid, silver dissolves, setting free sulphurous
acid. By the application of this process&mdash;which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">» 10 «</a></span>
is one of the most advantageous methods&mdash;silver
may readily be separated from gold, sulphuric acid
having no action upon the latter metal. With the
exception of gold, silver perhaps more perfectly
resists the action of the <i>caustic alkalies</i> and the
powerful effects of <i>nitre</i> (saltpetre) than any other
metal, if we omit platinum from the list of elements
at present known to metallurgical chemistry. For
reasons such as these its superiority for the manufacture
of utensils for culinary and other domestic
purposes is at once apparent, and because it is a
metal upon which <i>vegetable acids</i> produce no effect.</p>

<p class="caption3">Sources of Silver.</p>


<p>Strictly speaking, silver mining does not exist
as a distinct operation in Great Britain, for it can
hardly be said that this country possesses any great
quantity of silver ore. Yet we must not disguise
or leave unnoticed, in dealing with this subject, the
positive fact that silver is found to some extent in
our copper and lead mines, principally in the latter;
but in no case, as far as we know, have mines
been worked for the sake of the silver alone. It
is almost always found in conjunction with lead,
and it is from that source that we have a good
supply of British silver. The average annual yield
in the British Isles for some years has been equal
to 800,000 ounces&mdash;a position in regard to the
quantity produced ranking second only to Spain
amongst the nations of the world, America, of
course, being excepted. Silver is found in a native
state, the commonest ore being a sulphuret.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">» 12 «</a></span></p>

<p>The chief European supplies are derived from
Spain, in which country genuine silver ore exists;
from Saxony and Prussia, where the ores are principally
associated with lead, as in England; and
from Austria, where it is for the greater part found
mixed with copper. Silver is nearly always to be
found in copper and lead mines, but generally in
such small quantities that it is rarely worth the
trouble and expense of separation.</p>

<p>Considerably more than three-fourths of the whole
total supply of silver comes from America; and
in fact nearly the whole territory of America is
said to be more or less argentiferous. Until lately
Mexico carried off the palm, as containing and
yielding the largest percentage of silver; but
through the discovery of another mine in the United
States, at Nevada, of considerable richness, which
has yielded enormous supplies, we shall not be far
wrong in pronouncing the silver mines in the State
of Nevada to be the richest in the whole world.
The extensive production of these mines, combined
with other causes, has led to a considerable depreciation
in the value of silver, and probably this
may yet lead to its more extensive employment in
the arts and manufactures; and, in the midst of
the very general depression of the jewellery trade,
any change extending in that direction would be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">» 13 «</a></span>
joyfully accepted by the thousands of workmen in
the precious metal trades now standing idle. We
are told that, since the year 1860, the production of
silver has increased from an average yield of eight
or nine to fourteen millions per annum, or about
60 per cent.; while, on the other hand, the foreign
demand for the metal (formerly largely employed
for the currency) has greatly diminished. The rise
in cost of silver during the war years and those
immediately following necessitated an Act in Great
Britain &ldquo;to amend the law in respect of the standard
fineness of silver coins current in the United Kingdom
and in other parts of His Majesty&rsquo;s Dominions.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The chief sources of supply in the British Isles,
according to Professor George Gladstone, are as
given below; and as all the silver found in this
country is produced from lead ores, the average
yield here given must be understood to exist in
about that proportion to every ton of lead ore
assayed:&mdash;Isle of Man, 50 to 60 oz.; Cornwall,
about 30 oz.; Devonshire, about 30 oz.; Cardiganshire,
15 to 20 oz.; Montgomeryshire, 15 to 20 oz.
Thus, it will be seen the lead ores of the Isle of
Man yield the greatest proportion of silver in the
British dominions. Silver is also found in the undermentioned
counties, in all of which it is produced
from lead ore:&mdash;Cumberland, Durham, and Northumberland,

but the percentage is much smaller than in
the preceding cases. Ireland also yields a fair percentage
of silver.</p>

<p class="caption3">The Assay of Silver Ores.</p>


<p>A large proportion of the silver of commerce is
extracted from ores (which are too poor to allow of
their being smelted or fused) by a process called
amalgamation. Founded on the ready solubility
of silver, &amp;c., in metallic mercury, the ore is first
crushed to powder, then mixed with common salt,
and afterwards roasted. By the adoption of this
plan the silver is reduced to a state of chloride.
The roasting is done in a reverberatory furnace, in
which the heat is very gradually raised, the ore
being constantly stirred; the heat is then increased
sufficiently to raise the ore to a good red heat. It
is then put into wooden barrels, revolving on iron
axles attached to the ends, and scraps of iron are
then added to it; both are then agitated together
by rotary motion, the effect of which is to reduce
the chloride of silver to a metallic state. When
this is effected, it is again agitated with mercury,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">» 16 «</a></span>
and a fluid amalgam is formed with the metal,
together with any other metallic ingredient that
may happen to be present in the roasted ore.
Subsequently, to recover the silver, the mercury is
driven off by heat, and the silver is thus left behind
in an impure state.</p>

<p>There are three ways of assaying silver ores; they
are in the <i>test</i> assay as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p class="p0" style="margin-left: 40%;">
1. Melting in a crucible.<br />
2. Scorification.<br />
3. Cupellation.<br />
</p>

<p>In the crucible assay the ore is commonly run
down with a suitable flux, those most frequently
employed being litharge, carbonate of soda, borax,
and charcoal. These four substances are all that
are required by the practical assayer in the treatment
of the regular ores of silver.</p>

<div class="fig_caption">Fig. 2. Fire-clay
Crucible.</div>
</div>

<p>The assaying of the genuine ores is performed
in the following manner; that is,
if they contain but little earthy
matter. They may then be conveniently
treated by fusing with
carbonate of soda, on account of
its cheapness, and borax, in a
fire-clay crucible (<a href="#fig_2">Fig. 2</a>). The
dimensions of the crucible should
be as follows: 4&frac12; inches in height, and 2&frac12; inches
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">» 17 «</a></span>
in its greatest diameter, which should be at the
top. A quantity of litharge (a semi-vitrious substance,
oxide of lead), more than is actually necessary
to take up the whole of the silver in the ore,
should be added, so as to promote fusion, and
collect the ingredients into one mass at the bottom
of the crucible. In preparing the ore for the crucible,
it must be well pounded, and intimately
mixed with the undermentioned chemicals:&mdash;</p>

</table>

<p>Place two crucibles to warm during the time
occupied in the preparation of the mixture, then
put it into the warm crucible; take 100 grains
more of litharge, and powder it over the contents
in the vessel. Prepare in this manner a second
mixture for the other crucible, place them both
in the furnace, and put plenty of coke round
them. The mixtures may be melted in an ordinary
wind or melting furnace, such as is used by jewellers
in the preparation of their material for art
working. The fusion should take place very
gradually at first, as silver in combination with
lead is sensibly volatile at a high temperature: it
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">» 18 «</a></span>
may then be continued at a low heat for twenty-five
minutes, and finally the operation may be completed
with a full red heat for five minutes longer.</p>

<p>During the process of fusing the contents of the
crucible may be watched by removing one of the
bricks from the top of the furnace, and when the
whole mass has become quite liquid the crucible
must be seized with a pair of suitable tongs, tapped
once or twice very lightly against the side of the
furnace to procure the settlement of the contents,
and immediately poured into an iron mould,
previously warmed and greased to prevent adhesion
and spitting. Allow the mould to remain for some
time, in order to partially cool, and then plunge it
into a vessel of cold water. On cooling, the metallic
elements will be found incorporated into a button,
the slag can then easily be removed by tapping
with a hammer on the edge, and the plunging
into cold water greatly facilitates this separation.
The whole mass has then to be cupelled, in order to
separate the silver from the lead and other metals.</p>

<div class="fig_caption">Fig. 3. Fire-clay Fusing
Cup.</div>
</div>

<p>Silver ores, containing a large proportion of the
sulphides (chemical combinations of sulphur with
metallic substances) of other metals, may be easily
assayed by the scorification process, which is,
without exception, applicable to the assay of all
kinds of argentiferous ores; and is one of the best,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">» 19 «</a></span>
most simple, and most exact methods that can
possibly be employed in the extraction of silver
from its ores. This process, like that of fusion with
litharge, already described, has the effect of producing
an alloy, and subsequently requires cupellation.
The ore is first well pounded, and then
put into a small shallow vessel made of close-grained
refractory fire-clay
(<a href="#fig_3">Fig. 3</a>), with an excess of finely
granulated lead and some
borax. The fusing cup or
scorifier employed in this process
should be about 1&frac12; in.
high and 2&frac12; ins. in its greatest diameter; some
assayers, however, use them deeper in proportion
to their width, and representing in form the end of
an egg. The object of this shape is to preserve
the bath of molten metal at the bottom, and that
it may always be well covered and protected by
the slag on the top during the process of fusing.
In the scorification method the principles are exactly
the reverse of those of the crucible assay; for
in the latter the object is to reduce the oxide of
lead to a metallic state, whereas in the former the
metallic lead added to the pounded ore in the scorifier
is oxidized by being fused in contact with the
air. The charge for this assay may be as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">» 20 «</a></span></p>

<table summary="table">

  <td class="tdl">Powdered anthracite</td>

  <td>&rdquo;</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>The cups or scorifiers should be charged in the
following manner: well mix the silver ore with 300
grains of granulated lead; place this mixture in a
scorifier, and add 300 grs. more of granulated
lead, and over the top of the whole put the burnt
borax. The vessel may then be placed in an ordinary
assay furnace or muffle, as many being introduced
at one time as there is room for in the
furnace, and submitted to the strongest heat for
about thirty minutes; during the greater portion
of this time the door should be kept closed,
especially for the first fifteen minutes. On opening
the muffle-door a current of air passes through
the furnace, converting a portion of the lead into
litharge; this enters into combination with the
earthy portions of the ore, the other metallic sulphides,
and also the borax, producing a fusible
slag on the surface of the metallic bath, extending
over the whole surface of the scorifier. The excess
of lead is thus protected by this film or flux from
the oxidizing effects of the currents of air admitted
into the furnace, and remains united with whatever
silver there may be in the ore, in a metallic state.</p>

<p>The fusing should be continued longer than the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">» 21 «</a></span>
thirty minutes&mdash;in fact until the slag or flux is
reduced into a perfectly liquid state; stirring it
well with a slender iron rod will facilitate the operation,
as it will tend to mix with the mass any
hard portions remaining undissolved and attached
to the sides or other parts of the vessels. This
condition of the flux is absolutely indispensable;
when the slags are quite liquid, which with a
strong fire will take place in from thirty to forty
minutes, wrap up in a piece of paper the powdered
anthracite, and drop it into the scorifier while still
in the furnace or muffle. The object of adding the
anthracite at the last moment is to reduce any
minute portions of the metal that may exist in the
slags, and remain separated from the bulk. When
the anthracite has burnt off, which process usually
takes about five minutes, this point is considered
to have been attained, and the operation is then
complete. The scorifier may be immediately withdrawn
from the fire, and the contents poured into a
suitable casting-mould, of the form represented in
<a href="#fig_4">Fig. 4</a>, a button of silver lead being the result. When
cold, the metallic mass is readily separated from the
slag or flux by slightly tapping with a hammer; the
former may then be passed on to the next operation,
viz. to be purified of its lead by the process of
cupellation, which will be presently described.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">» 22 «</a></span></p>

<p>When there is not enough borax present the
assayer will observe an infusible skin floating upon
the surface; should this be the case more borax
must at once be employed, in order to dissolve
such impurity. When a chloride of silver ore is
to be assayed, carbonate of soda must be added to
the mixture to prevent sublimation.</p>

<p>The following method of assaying is adopted in
several large Continental establishments, where
the ores have, beside the usual earthy matter and
the sulphides of lead, an admixture of zinc, iron,
and copper. The process is precisely similar to the
crucible assay, in the case of genuine silver ores,
as already described&mdash;with this exception, that no
more lead is added than the ores then contain&mdash;that
is, if we are treating <i>galena</i> or <i>silver lead</i>;
other ores require different treatment according
to their known composition. In this process
wrought-iron crucibles are employed having the
form and shape as shown in <a href="#fig_5">Fig. 5</a>. They are
made of thick iron plate, and are rendered secure
by welding the edges firmly together. Their
dimensions are as follows: a depth of 4&frac12; ins.,
with a thickness of iron at the bottom of 1&frac12; in.,
and a &frac14; of an inch in the sides; the diameter at
the top of the crucible should be about 2&frac12; ins., and
at the bottom between 2 and 2&frac14; ins. A mechanical
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">» 23 «</a></span>
mixture or flux is prepared to use with the ores to
which we have referred, consisting of the following
chemicals, all of which should be finely powdered
and well mixed with the ore to be assayed:&mdash;</p>

<table summary="table">

<p>The furnace used for this assay is the ordinary
one, having rather a high chimney, to insure a
perfect draught. In effecting the reduction of the
silver, the crucible is first placed as before on the
fire, and allowed to become hot; when this is
accomplished, take</p>

<table summary="table">

  <td class="tdl">Well powdered ore</td>

</tr>
</table>

<p>These ingredients should be thoroughly mixed
together, and put into the red hot crucible. Fuse
at a low heat for about twenty minutes, when the
whole will be in a perfect state of fusion; then
give about five minutes strong heat, and at the
end of that time the crucible may be withdrawn,
and its contents poured into an iron mould, as
represented in <a href="#fig_4">Fig. 4</a>, having one or two conical
holes for the reception of the fused mass. The
silver and lead collect at the bottom of the mould
by reason of its high specific gravity. It may be
removed by reversing the position of the latter,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">» 24 «</a></span>
when a gentle tap or two will deprive it of that
slag or flux which is usually attached to it. A
large quantity of silver can be readily collected
from its ores by an alternate use of crucibles, in
which case it is possible to make a regular number
of fusions per hour. Wrought-iron crucibles, when
strongly prepared and carefully made, will stand
about thirty of these fusions, giving way in the end
on account of the action of the sulphur contained
in the ores.</p>

<p>Another kind of crucible, in addition to those
already mentioned, is used by the trade, and is
recommended by many assayers as superior to all
others. <a href="#fig_6">Fig. 6</a> represents the form of it. It is
about 4&frac12; ins. high, and 2 ins. in its greatest
interior diameter, being in the form of a skittle.

<p>Put the powdered ore into the crucible, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">» 25 «</a></span>
place upon it the iron, which should not be in the
form of filings or dust, but in small pieces; upon
the ore and iron should be put the black flux, and
lastly the common salt must be placed above all
these substances as a protection against the air.
The crucibles, as many as convenient, may now
be introduced into the furnace, and slowly raised
to a strong red heat, at which temperature they
should be kept for about half an hour; at the end
of that period they should be removed from the
fire, slightly tapped to settle the contents, and then
placed aside to cool. When this has taken place,
a few blows with a hammer near the base of the
crucibles, each in turn, will soon expose the button
of silver attached to the undecomposed iron; the
latter substance may, however, be easily detached
by a few well-directed blows with the hammer.</p>

<p>In order to ascertain the exact amount of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">» 26 «</a></span>
precious metal&mdash;that is, the silver&mdash;contained in the
buttons of lead obtained as the results of the foregoing
operations, they are subjected to a purifying
process by the metallurgist, called cupellation. By
this means the lead and other impurities are driven
off by heat in contact with a current of air, and the
silver is left behind in a pure state. To perform
this operation it is necessary to expose the buttons
on some absorbing medium or porous support,
and this support is commonly known as a <i>cupel</i>.
No doubt many porous substances could be made
available for the formation of cupels, but bone-ash
is the best for all practical purposes, such as are
required by the assayer. The bone-ash, in the
condition of a very fine powder, is mixed with a
little water in which has been dissolved a small
quantity of potash, and moulded into the desired
shape. The cupels are tightly consolidated by
pressure in an iron mould of the form shown in
<a href="#fig_7">Fig. 7</a>, which is the best in use, being well adapted
for the manufacture of cupels. It consists of a
slightly conical steel ring, 2 ins. in depth, and
about 1&frac12; in. in diameter at the top internally;
a steel die with a wooden handle (<a href="#fig_8">Fig. 8</a>) is made
to fit the mould. To make a cupel the space in the
ring is nearly filled with the moistened bone-ash,
and pressed down by the hand, and afterwards by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">» 27 «</a></span>
the die, the latter being driven into the ring by the
application of a wooden mallet (<a href="#fig_9">Fig. 9</a>) to the handle
of the die. It will be seen from the illustration
that the die forms a cavity in the cupel capable of
receiving the charge of metal for assay. When the
bone-ash has been sufficiently compressed, the die
is withdrawn, and the cupel removed from the ring.
This is a delicate operation, as sometimes the edges
of the cupel are liable to be injured; to prevent
which and facilitate the removal a loose plate of
iron, exactly fitting the bottom of the mould, should
be introduced previous to putting in the bone-ash.
The iron plate of course being removed with the
cupel, it must be replaced before another can be
made. By introducing a cylindrical piece of wood
to the lower aperture of the steel ring, the cupel
can be removed without difficulty.</p>

<p>The size of the cupel should always be regulated

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">» 28 «</a></span>
absorbed, it being generally understood that the
material of which it is formed takes up double its
weight of lead. The process of cupelling is conducted
in the furnace of the assayer, an apparatus
of peculiar construction, the most important part of
which, however, is the muffle
(<a href="#fig_10">Fig. 10</a>), consisting of a small
arched oven of fire-clay closed
at one end, and furnished
with perpendicular slits in
the sides, in order to allow of a free access of air to
the cupels inside.</p>

<span class="fig_caption">Fig. 12. Cupels, section and perspective views.</span>
</div>

<p>The position of the muffle in the furnace is so
arranged that it can be readily heated on every
side; and when it has become red hot, six or eight
cupels, previously well dried, are taken and placed
on the floor of it, which should be covered with a
thin layer of bone-ash. The form of tongs required
for this purpose is shown in <a href="#fig_11">Fig. 11</a>. When the
cupels have been raised to the temperature of the
muffle itself, the assays are put in by a very slender
pair of tongs, the door of the furnace is then closed
for a few minutes, when the metal will have become
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">» 29 «</a></span>
fused, and the litharge will begin to be taken up by
the bone-ash of which the cupel is composed. The
temperature of the furnace is now lowered as much
as possible, although not to such an extent that it
will retard the progress of oxidation and absorption.
When nearly the whole of the lead has been
thus absorbed, the bead remaining will have become
very rich in silver, and, as the oxidation proceeds,
will appear much agitated, assuming a rapid circular
movement, and revolving with great rapidity.
The silver gradually concentrates itself in the
centre of the cupel, taking the form of a globule,
and at this stage the fire should be made sharper,
the operation being carefully watched. When the
last particle of lead leaves the silver, the agitation
will suddenly cease, and a beautiful phenomenon
be witnessed, called by assayers the <i>brightening</i>.
The button of silver then becomes brilliant and
immovable, and the operation, when this takes
place, is complete. The cupel must be cooled with
very great care, in order to prevent the silver from
<i>sprouting</i>; which if allowed to take place would
result in considerable loss, besides destroying the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">» 30 «</a></span>
accuracy of the assay. To prevent this sprouting
it is a good plan immediately to cover the cupel by
another, which has been heated for that purpose;
the two are withdrawn together, and allowed to
remain at the mouth of the muffle until the silver
has become solid; the metal is then in a state of
almost chemical purity, and may be detached and
weighed. Previous to the latter, however, it should
be carefully cleansed from all foreign matter, and
flattened on a smooth-faced anvil, this process
greatly assisting in the removal of any oxide of
lead, which not unfrequently attaches itself to the
globule of silver. The weighing is conducted with
a pair of scales having an extremely delicate
balance; and where any commercial transaction
depends upon the accuracy of the assay, it is
always imperative to make several tests of the
same sample, to avoid the consequences of any
accident or mistake.</p>

<p>The chief element in combination with silver on
the large scale is lead. Formerly the plan adopted
in the separation of this metal was cupellation
alone. This process on the large scale is somewhat
different from that just described; and as it
may appear to the reader interesting and instructive,
a brief explanation of it may not be considered
out of place.</p>

<p class="caption3">The Cupellation of Silver Ores.</p>


<p>This interesting process is performed in a reverberatory
furnace of a very peculiar construction,
the cupel employed on the large scale differing
somewhat from the ordinary one, being considerably
larger and varying also in form. It consists
of a strong oval wrought-iron ring, with a part of
the full shape omitted, as shown in accompanying
sketch, in order to allow of the overflow of lead
during the process, in the form of litharge. This
iron ring, known as the <i>test ring</i>, contains the
cupel, and in order to prepare the latter, the frame,
which measures about 60 ins. in its longest diameter,
40 ins. in breadth, and 6 ins. in depth,
is strengthened by having a number of broad
strips of iron seamed across the bottom by riveting
to the sides of it. The cupel itself is prepared
for use by taking finely ground bone-ash, together
with a little carbonate of potash, and working them
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">» 32 «</a></span>
up with just sufficient water to make the mass
cohere properly; the carbonate of potash may be
advantageously dissolved in the water; the latter
is then applied in small quantities at a time to the
bone-ash until the proper coherency has been
obtained; of the total quantity of bone-ash employed
in the operation, 2 per cent. of potash will
be <i>quantum sufficit</i> to mix with it. The iron frame,
or test, is then filled with the mixture, and it is
pressed down into a solid compact mass, the centre
part being hollowed out with a small trowel, the
sides sloping towards the concavity in the middle;
the hollow should not however be extended more
than within 1 to 1&frac12; in. of
the bottom of the frame,
and above the iron bars.
The cupel forms the
hearth of the furnace we
have spoken of, and of
which <a href="#fig_13">Fig. 13</a> is a sectional
view; it is removable,
and not a fixture in
the furnace. It must be
left for several days to
dry, after having been
constructed as described,
when it is ready for use, and only requires firmly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">» 33 «</a></span>
wedging in its place beneath the arch of the
furnace.</p>

<div class="fig_center" style="width: 337px;">

<span class="fig_caption">Fig. 13. Cupels, section and perspective views.</span>
</div>

<p>The fire should be only very moderate at
the commencement of the operation, and the
furnace slowly raised in temperature, lest the
cupel should crack by being too quickly heated.
As the temperature increases, if without any
apparent defects in the bone-ash cupel, or
hearth, which it may now be termed, the wind or
blast, generally driven by a fan, is thrown in
through a nozzle, or an aperture in the furnace,
which, for facilitating the immediate removal of the
bone-ash hearth, is placed upon an iron car, and
runs beneath the vault of the furnace on rails, so
that it may thus be very readily withdrawn when
found necessary. The admission of a current of air
into the furnace oxidizes the excess of lead, in combination
with the silver, producing litharge on the
surface of the molten mass; the formation of the
litharge takes place rapidly, and it is continually
blown forward by the strength of the blast as fast
as it is produced, running through a gap or channel
specially made for the purpose in the mouth of the
cupel into a movable iron pot which is placed for
its reception. The continual oxidization and flow-off
of the lead alters the respective proportions of
the metals in the cupel. For this reason it is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">» 34 «</a></span>
always kept full of lead ore, which is effected by
taking it in its fused state from a kettle in which it
is ready melted by means of a long-handled ladle;
and thus about 500 or 600 lbs. of metal are constantly
kept in this bone-ash cupel or hearth.</p>

<p>As the silver necessarily increases in the hearth,
it will require to be occasionally withdrawn, in
order to make room for a further supply of lead ore.
This process is adopted when it reaches about from
8 to 10 per cent. of silver to the ton (between 2,000
and 3,000 ozs.), and may be effectually performed
by drilling a hole underneath the cupel, and letting
the silver flow through it into a receptacle placed
to receive it. Of course the operations of the furnace
are arrested while these manipulations are
being carried on. After the withdrawal of the
silver, the hole is closed up again with a plug of
moistened bone-ash prepared as before; when the
process may be continued a second time by giving
500 or 600 lbs. of fresh lead ore to the cupel. Thus
a single cupel will often last 48 hours, and 6 or 7
tons of lead may be oxidized upon it.</p>

<p>We have already observed that the prolongation
of the cupelling process increases the richness of
the remaining alloy, and this very rich silver-lead
alloy is again subjected to a second operation in
cupelling. This process of assaying or refining
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">» 35 «</a></span>
is similar in every respect to the former, and is
often performed in the same furnace, the cupel
being first of all brought to almost a bright red
heat, when about 600 lbs. of the silver-lead
alloy are added, and a strong current of air given
in order to oxidize the remaining lead in combination
with the silver. In this operation the
material under treatment, previous to its introduction
to the cupel, should be melted in a
kettle easy of access, and added in its fused state.
The current of air in connection with the heat of
the furnace immediately begins to purify the
silver by oxidizing the lead, and forms litharge,
which passes off through the channel provided in
the mouth of the cupel; as this proceeds, fresh
silver-lead alloy is added, to keep the level of the
metal always at the same height. This is continued
until some three tons of the alloy from the
first cupellation have been put in, and when about
600 or 700 lbs. of silver are collected in the cupel.</p>

<p>When the cupel has received the above proportion
of metal, the addition of the alloy ceases,
and the silver is allowed to purify. The litharge
which passes off towards the close of this process
will be richer in silver than in the former one;
consequently it is found best in practical metallurgical
operations to treat in a special manner the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">» 36 «</a></span>
last part of silver cupelling on the large scale, for
it needs very careful management indeed to
secure all the silver, especially to do so in a fine
state. Towards the completion of the process the
fire should be increased considerably, in order to
keep the silver thoroughly melted, and also to
oxidize and completely remove every trace of lead
that is possible. As it begins to purify itself from
the remaining lead a characteristic brightness
will be perceived. When this takes place the
fire must be lowered, the wind or blast stopped,
and the metal left to cool gradually. This latter
proceeding is of some importance, as a too sudden
cooling of the surface causes the interior of the
metal to expand and shoot, by which means little
globules of silver may be lost; therefore it should
be allowed to cool very slowly.</p>

<p>The iron ring encircling the cupel with its contents
may now be drawn from beneath the arch of
the furnace, and the cake of silver taken from its
bed in the bone-ash which formed the vessel, and
cleaned of any impurity; when it may be re-melted
in a plumbago crucible, and cast into ingot
moulds. These moulds should be made of iron,
and should always, when used for this purpose, be
warmed and greased a little, previous to the introduction
of the melted material, to prevent the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">» 37 «</a></span>
metal from spitting and adhering to it. If skilfully
treated during the process of cupellation, the
desilvered lead seldom contains more than &middot;002
to &middot;003 per cent. of silver to the test assay of
200 grs., or between six and ten pennyweights
to the ton, beyond which point it is unprofitable
to carry on the operation.</p>

<p>The litharge which is formed and passes off
during the process gradually grows richer in
silver towards the end of the cupellation. It
probably contains after concentration about thirty
to forty ounces of silver to the ton of litharge.
This is again subjected to the several operations
of the same kind for the recovery of the silver.</p>

<p>It is somewhat remarkable that the present
method of recovering and purifying this metal
bears a strong resemblance to that employed in
ancient times, and which is spoken of in the Holy
Scriptures by the prophet Ezekiel (xxii. 18 and 20):
&ldquo;Son of man, the house of Israel is to me become
dross: all they are brass, and tin, and iron, and
lead, in the midst of the furnace; they are even the
dross of silver.&rdquo; And also, &ldquo;As they gather silver,
and brass, and iron, and lead, and tin, into the midst
of the furnace, to blow the fire upon it, to melt it;
so will I gather you in mine anger and in my fury,
and I will leave you there, and melt you.&rdquo; The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">» 38 «</a></span>
celebrated metallurgist Dr. Lamborn says, &ldquo;Only
those who have seen, beneath the glowing arch
at the smelting works, flames surging wave after
wave across the surface of the liquid metal, carrying
all the substances, here called dross, from the
pure silver; and only those who have heard the
roar of the fiery blast, that ceases neither day
nor night, until its task of purification is accomplished,&mdash;can
appreciate the terrible force of the
figure made use of by the prophet.&rdquo; According
to the above scriptural passage it is evident that
the ancients were in possession of the first rudiments
of assaying, and understood to some extent
the purification of metals; but scriptural testimony
does not point out with what amount of skill and
success these operations were performed. Judging
from the appliances which have been handed down
from generation to generation, we are inclined to
think they must have been practised somewhat
rudely; for it has been left to the present school
of scientific and practical metallurgists to found
and develop the art in the direction of that commercial
success to which it has at the present day
attained.</p>

<p>This plan of cupellation which we have just
described is still adopted in many continental
works in the assaying of silver-lead ores. In
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">» 39 «</a></span>
England the system has been almost entirely
superseded by one invented by the late Mr. Pattinson
of Newcastle, and which is confidently stated
to be far more convenient in practice.</p>

<p class="caption3">The Alloys of Silver.</p>


<p>Fine silver enters freely into combination with
nearly all the useful metals, but its most important
alloys are those prepared from copper, the latter
substance being more suitable for the production
of silversmith&rsquo;s work than any other; whilst it
produces a more pleasing effect, if not over-alloyed,
in regard to finish. Silver articles, especially of
the <i>filigree</i> kinds, if the designs are good, possess a
very tasteful appearance. In treating of the alloys
of silver, it is our intention, first, to give a cursory
glance at the chemical and physical properties of
the metals which form these alloys. Such a description,
although brief, will, we believe, prove of
essential service, not only to working silversmiths
and metalsmiths, but also to goldsmiths and
jewellers, who are constantly manipulating with
these inferior metals in precisely the same way as
the silversmith. Besides, such information cannot,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">» 41 «</a></span>
we apprehend, fail to be useful, whether to the
student, the theorist, or the practical worker.</p>

<p>An alloy is the union of two or more metals by
fusion, so as to form a metallic compound. It may
consist of any number of the metallic elements,
and in any proportion, provided they will chemically
combine, always excepting mercury as one of
the ingredients. In this latter case the mixture
is called an <i>amalgam</i>. Chemistry has made us
acquainted with about forty-nine metals; of that
number, however, not more than fourteen are
employed to any considerable extent for industrial
art purposes. They are as follow: Gold, silver,
copper, zinc, platinum, aluminum, nickel, iron,
mercury, lead, tin, arsenic, antimony, and bismuth.
Some of these are occasionally employed for <i>special</i>
purposes in the arts in their pure state; but where
hardness is to be a distinguishing characteristic,
combined with certain variations in shades of
colour, a union is effected of two or more of these
metals in different proportions, by fusion and stirring,
so as to form the requisite alloy. Metals
used in the pure state, that is, without any mixture
of alloy, have very few applications in regard to
industrial pursuits and the arts. The precious
metals&mdash;gold, silver, &amp;c.&mdash;would be much too soft,
while, on the other hand, arsenic, bismuth, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">» 42 «</a></span>
antimony would be far too brittle to be employed
alone for manufacturing purposes. It is quite
possible to effect some thousands of alloys, but
there do not appear to have been more than about
three hundred practised successfully for commercial
purposes.</p>

<p>The principal alloy of silver, as we have already
remarked, is copper; but, occasionally, nickel, and
even zinc are employed in the case of the commoner
qualities of silver. Tin is also used in the
preparation of solder for these qualities, in order to
render it the more easy of fusion when used for
soldering the work. Of the distinctive features of
these elements of silver-alloy we shall now speak
with some amount of detail.</p>

<p>Silver will unite with copper in various proportions
by melting the two ingredients together,
and stirring them whilst in a fused state. A
product will thus be formed differing physically in
character from fine silver, caused by the loss of
some little of the latter&rsquo;s ductility and malleability;
but, on the other hand, a compound will be produced
harder and more elastic, which is in every
sense better adapted to the manufacture and also
to the durability of the articles made by the silversmith.</p>

<p><i>Copper</i>, like the precious metals, appears to have
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">» 43 «</a></span>
been known from a very early age, being one of
the six metals spoken of in the Old Testament;
and described by the historian as being also one of
the seven made use of by the ancient philosopher.
It is of a reddish colour, malleable, ductile, and
tenacious. It is largely employed in alloying both
gold and silver for the manufacture of jewellery
and other articles. With regard to malleability, it
stands next to gold and silver in the list of useful
metals; in ductility it occupies the fifth position;
and in tenacity one only is superior, viz. iron. It
is not very fixed in the fire, for if subjected to a
long-continued heat it loses a part of its substance;
for this reason the alloys of silver and copper
should be carefully watched in the crucible to
prevent this loss when under the action of the fire.</p>

<p>When struck copper gives only a feeble sound,
and is easily abraded by the file. It fuses at a good
white heat, or about 1994&deg; Fahr., although some
authors have given it as 1996&deg; Fahr. Its specific
gravity varies between 8&middot;88 for cast copper, and 8&middot;96
when rolled and hammered. It loses between one-eighth
and one-ninth, or 4/35ths, of its weight in water.
When exposed to a damp atmosphere a greenish
oxide, called verdigris, is produced on its surface,
and this is one of the reasons why silver articles
containing a percentage of copper become so
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">» 44 «</a></span>
readily discoloured if left exposed to atmospheric
influences; copper also, if heated in contact with
the air, quickly becomes oxidized, and, on being
touched, scales fall off: these form the <i>protoxide of
copper</i>. If this process is frequently repeated under
a great heat, each time the metal is operated upon
it loses a part of its malleability and ductility,
which are both eminent characteristics of the pure
metal. Most of the ordinary acids act on copper
but slowly in the cold, but nitric acid very readily
dissolves it, even if largely diluted. Copper amalgamates
with most of the metals, and its subsidiary
alloys are very largely employed in the arts and
manufactures of every kind.</p>

<p>The bean-shot copper of commerce, costing
about a shilling per pound avoirdupois weight,
is quite good enough for all the practical purposes
of the silversmith.</p>

<span class="fig_caption">Fig. 14. <i>Venus.</i>
Egyptian Mark for Copper.</span>
</div>

<p>The name given to this metal by the alchemists
was <i>Venus</i> (<a href="#fig_14">Fig. 14</a>), which is one of
the principal planets, whose orbit is
situated between the Earth and Mercury.
The scientific name of <i>cuprum</i>
for copper is derived from the Isle of
Cyprus, where, it is said by Pliny,
the Greeks discovered the method of mining and
working it. Copper is found distributed all over
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">» 45 «</a></span>
the world; a considerable portion, however, is
found in the United Kingdom.</p>

<p><i>Nickel.</i>&mdash;This metal is found chiefly in the Hartz
Mountains. It was formerly called by the Germans
&ldquo;Kupfer nickel,&rdquo; or false copper, &ldquo;nickel&rdquo; being a
term of detraction. It was first discovered about a
century and a half ago by Cronstedt. It has a
greyish-white colour, and is slightly magnetic, <i>i.e.</i>
it is attracted by the magnet in the same way as iron
and steel, but it loses this property if heated to
about 600&deg; Fahr. Its specific gravity varies between
8&middot;40 and 8&middot;50, according to the amount of compression
it has received, and it is rather brittle; it
may, however, be drawn into wire, and rolled flat,
or into sheets. It is considerably harder and less
ductile than any of the other metals employed
in jeweller&rsquo;s and silversmith&rsquo;s work. In hardness it
nearly approaches iron, and on this account, when
polished, a characteristic brightness is produced.
The malleability of nickel is less than that of iron,
standing tenth in the list of useful metals; and
in ductility it also occupies the tenth position.
Nickel is very infusible, and does not so easily
oxidize or tarnish at ordinary temperatures as copper
does. Several countries have tried to employ
it in the manufacture of small coin for the currency,
but its use has now been almost abandoned.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">» 46 «</a></span></p>

<p>Nickel alloys are much used in the arts for
manufacturing purposes, under the name of &ldquo;German
silver,&rdquo; there being large demand for this
metal, as it forms the hard white alloy much used
in making &ldquo;electro-plate,&rdquo; and on which silver is
afterwards deposited. It also is used in common
silver alloys, in order to keep up the whiteness of
the latter element, the addition of too large a
proportion of copper maintaining the tint of the
latter metal, in too strong a degree to be altogether
employed by the silver-worker. Nickel is sometimes
<i>specially</i> employed, in combination with other
metals, to replace or imitate silver in the manufacture
of commercial wares, while with copper,
zinc, tin, &amp;c., it forms very useful alloys, producing
great hardness.</p>

<p><i>Zinc.</i>&mdash;This metal in its pure state is sometimes
called <i>spelter</i>. At the present day it is not much
used for alloying silver; but, as it is commonly
employed in the preparation of silver-solder, it is
necessary that the amateur and the student should
know, as well as the practical mechanic, the distinctive
characteristics of it, together with the
qualities it imparts to others when in combination
with them. As a metallic substance it was unknown
until a long time subsequent to the discovery
of the principal metals; and only since the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">» 47 «</a></span>
commencement of the present century has its uses
been thoroughly known and appreciated in the
industrial world. In its pure state, zinc is a bluish-white
metal, hard and highly crystalline; but,
when raised to a heat of between 250&deg; and 300&deg;
Fahr., it is malleable, and may safely be rolled
and hammered: it is in this way that the zinc of
commerce is produced.</p>

<p>Zinc may be annealed by placing it for a time in
boiling water. Its specific gravity varies between
6&middot;8 and 7&middot;2, according to the previous kind
of mechanical treatment it has received. At 773&deg; Fahr. it
melts, and is quickly oxidized by exposure to a
current of air, emitting white vapours, which rise
into the air, and are not unlike cotton-flakes;
oxide of zinc is thus formed by the burning away
of the zinc. Spelter or zinc is employed by jewellers
in the manufacture of bright gold alloys, as it
gives liveliness of colour to their wares not to be
equalled by any other metal. (For the proportions
and treatment of this composition see &ldquo;The Goldsmith&rsquo;s
Handbook.&rdquo;) It may be alloyed with most
of the metals we have named; its uses in roofing,
gutters, spouting, and chimney-pots being all well
known. All the acids very readily attack it in the
gold, and even when largely diluted; it speedily
tarnishes, and becomes covered with a white oxide
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">» 48 «</a></span>
which protects the metal from atmospheric influences.
In point of malleability zinc stands eighth
among the metals, seventh in ductility, and as regards
tenacity about seventh also. In chemistry
it is represented by the symbol <i>Zn</i>. Its value when
in a state of purity, commercially speaking, is
about 4<i>d.</i> per. lb.</p>

<p><i>Tin.</i>&mdash;This appears to have been one of the
oldest known metals, and was employed in the
Egyptian arts by the ancients, in combination with
copper. Its colour is white, with a shining lustre
almost as brilliant as that of silver, but it tarnishes
much more quickly than alloys of the latter metal.
With the exception of aluminum and zinc, it is
the lightest of all the metals, its density being
between 7&middot;0 and 7&middot;3, whether cast, hammered, or
rolled. It is found in abundance in Cornwall,
where it was also obtained at a very early period
by the Ph&oelig;nicians; and it is reported in Soame&rsquo;s
&ldquo;Latin Church,&rdquo; p. 30, that it was through the
medium of the trade in tin that Christianity was
first introduced into this country. Tin is not of a
fixed nature like gold or silver, but melts in a
moderate fire long before it becomes red hot, or
about 442&deg; Fahr. It is rapidly oxidized when kept
for a long time in a fire having a free access to the
air; and it is dissolved by hydrochloric, sulphuric,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">» 49 «</a></span>
and nitric acids, the latter acting on it most powerfully.
Tin should not be alloyed with gold or
silver, as with either of these it easily enters into
combination by fusion, rendering them extremely
brittle, especially in the case of silver, which becomes
by the least mixture of it so brittle that it
is totally unfit for the work of the silversmith.
However, for solder, for filing into dust, it may be
advantageously employed to promote a quicker
fusion; but even for this it should be avoided
where it is possible to do so. The vapours of tin
are also permanently injurious in the melting of
gold, silver, and their alloys, as they render them
very unworkable, and the operator being often at a
loss to understand the cause of his misfortune;
therefore, in melting silver alloys, it is advisable to
avoid as much as possible the introduction of little
bits of scrap tin into the furnace. If such a thing
should happen, however, make the fire once or
twice stronger in order that the tin may all be
destroyed before the crucible containing the silver
alloy is put in.</p>

<p>Tin is very malleable, moderately ductile, and
tenacious, being fifth on the list for malleability,
eighth for ductility, and eighth for tenacity. The
Egyptian mark or symbol for tin (sign of &ldquo;Jupiter&rdquo;)
was the same as is represented in <a href="#fig_15">Fig. 15</a>,
and related to the planet of that name, one
remarkable for its brightness. <i>In mythology</i> it is
understood as representing the supreme
deity of the Greeks and Romans. The
modern scientific name for tin is Sn.
Tin loses over one-seventh, or 4/29ths, of
its weight in water from its absolute
weight in air. In the next chapter we shall treat
of the mixing of silver alloys, &amp;c., and in order to
make our information regarding the various metals
so employed as complete as possible, we shall

<p>The chemical and physical properties of fine silver
having been dealt with in a preceding chapter,
we shall not refer to them again in detail; but,
as we have already observed that it is sometimes
employed in <i>its pure</i> state for special purposes, it
is desirable that we should point out the uses to
which it has been applied, especially those of a
mechanical nature. With reference to the latter
part of the subject we will now proceed to describe
the commercial utility of the metal.</p>

<p>One of the greatest demands for pure silver&mdash;if
not the greatest of all&mdash;is in the manufacture
of fine filigree work, a branch of industry extensively
practised on the Continent. This kind of
silversmith&rsquo;s work was attempted to be revived
in this country during the years 1864-5, Birmingham
and London being the principal places
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">» 53 «</a></span>
where the manufacture was carried on; but the
success of the undertaking as a staple industry
must, at the most, have been only a partial one, for
it soon declined, and the trade was thus virtually
left, as before, in the hands of our Eastern competitors;
most of whom produce splendid specimens
of the art of filigree and fine wire-working. In
India this work is wonderfully performed, and it is
truly marvellous to witness the beautiful handiwork
of the natives who practise this craft. Their
productions are quite the work of the true artist,
almost every article representing Nature in some
of her various forms, such as flowers, animals,
serpents, &amp;c., and these are so skilfully imitated
that no one could possibly dispute either the faithfulness
of the representation or the ability of the
workman. This is all the more surprising, because
in India the natives have not the modern
mechanical appliances which we possess in this
country. The jeweller there represents to some
extent our travelling tinker, only with this difference,
that the travelling tinker in this country is
generally an inexperienced and unskilful workman,
whereas the Indian, if we are to judge him
by his work, must be just the reverse.</p>

<p>Filigree wire-work is manufactured in Italy,
Germany, Norway, and Sweden, and the secret of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">» 54 «</a></span>
these countries maintaining the monopoly in this
branch of the silversmith&rsquo;s trade is that labour
there is cheap; and not in any sense because
English workmen cannot make the articles in
question. It is owing to this cheapness of labour
and the inexpensiveness of living that our Continental
competitors can beat us by underselling
us in the market; and to no other cause can
the production of the foreign cheap article be
assigned.</p>

<p>In India the art of working in silver and gold
has long been practised, and so particular are the
workmen there about the absolute purity of the
metals they use, that they refine them by melting
five times, under a very strong blast heat, before
commencing the work of manufacture. The principal
places where these art-manufactures are
carried on are in Southern India and at Trichinopoly;
and in these districts the delicacy and
intricacy of the workmanship are brought to the
greatest possible perfection. The articles produced
there are all &ldquo;hand-made,&rdquo; and wrought
entirely with a few simple tools, such as a hammer
and an anvil (both of which are highly polished
and burnished), a few fine pliers, blow-pipes,
burnishers, scrapers, a pair of fine dividers, and
some delicate scales and weights; these, with a few
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">» 55 «</a></span>
perforated steel-plates for drawing the wire through,
comprise the chief appliances of the travelling
native jewellers. The process of the work is very
simple. It is commenced by hammering out the
metal upon the anvil, and when it has assumed a
certain degree of thinness the dividers are next
brought into requisition to mark it into certain
widths, which are subsequently cut into strips and
drawn into very fine wire through perforated steel-plates,
a pair of strong pliers being used for the
purpose. The holes in the steel-plates consist of
graduated sizes, and by this means the strips of
metal are soon considerably reduced; and when
the proper thinness has been attained the wire is
ready for the exercise of the practical skill and
dexterity of the artisan, who produces from it the
best filigree work in the world. Most of the
native jewellers have books containing a variety
of designs, but they more commonly work from
memory, without any reference to patterns.</p>

<p>The principal localities where this description of
work is produced in the highest perfection are Delhi,
Cuttack, and Trichinopoly, in India; and Genoa,
Paris, Florence, Malta, Norway, and Sweden. The
Indian filigree work is the finest and cheapest
in the world. The Maltese manufacture a very
good kind, and their crosses are much admired;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">» 56 «</a></span>
so also do the Chinese and Japanese, but the
manufactures of these latter countries are not so
tasteful as those of India, consequently they have
not been so highly appreciated. Norway and
Sweden produce filigree work of a very light
weight; but still their productions in this art will
not compare in regard to effect with the finest
specimens from India.</p>

<p>We have said that the silver employed by the
filigree worker should be in every case absolutely
pure; because, when it is quite fine, it is extremely
soft and pliable, so that it will remain in almost
any form the artist may choose to work it, without
that springiness which is found in all alloyed
metals. However small might be the amount of
alloy contained in the metal, the least admixture of
it would produce an elasticity in the wire when
pressed into form which would make it unworkable
for fine filigree purposes; and in this state it would
be the utter bane of the workman, as his progress
would be altogether impeded in the production of
his work. It is of the greatest importance that
the spirals, and all the various forms required in
filigree working, should remain steadily in their
places when pressed into shape, without that rebounding
which happens in the case of metals of
an elastic nature, and in consequence of which no
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">» 57 «</a></span>
really first-class work can be performed in connection
with this art. For such reasons as these it will
be at once palpable even to the ordinary reader that
fine silver should always be used in preference to
alloyed in the manufacture of filigree work.</p>

<p>The various ornaments of the filigree kind are
commonly enclosed in a rim of plain and somewhat
stronger wire, which gives additional strength to
each part; and, when put together, tends to compose
an article of considerably greater durability.
In England these outside rims consist exclusively
of sterling or standard silver, whilst all the inner
work is of the finer material.</p>

<p>There are several methods of preparing the wire
called &ldquo;filigree.&rdquo; The oldest and the one almost
invariably practised in India consists in the first
place in drawing down the wire in a circular form
until the very lowest possible thinness has been
attained, and frequently annealing it during the
process, which is done by heating it to a red heat
in a muffle placed upon an iron or copper pan.
When this process has been effectually performed
the wire is taken (if of the proper degree of thinness)
and doubled together; these two fine wires
are then twisted into one cord, which should be of
the fineness desired. The wire requires annealing
more than once during the process of twisting, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">» 58 «</a></span>
when it is completed it has a corded appearance,
it is then ready for the manufacture of the various
articles comprised in this kind of work.</p>

<p>The old plan of twisting was accomplished in the
following manner. One end of the doubled wire
being firmly secured in a vice or some other suitable
instrument, so as to prevent it from turning round
and so prevent the progress of the work, the other
end of it was also firmly secured in a small hand
machine or vice, which was made to revolve by
turning a small handle with the right hand, the
machine being held and regulated with the left,
in order to keep the wire out at its full length so
as to avoid knotting in the various parts of it; it
was in this manner that fine filigree wire was in
the first instance made.</p>

<p>The second plan was somewhat different, and
in regard to the last part of the process it was
certainly a great advantage, especially in the
saving of labour, as a greater quantity could be
prepared in a much less time than by the old
method, that being slow in its progress. Here the
lathe was made to supply the place of the small
hand machine, the speed of which soon brought
about the object in view.</p>

<p>The flattening of this twisted wire has now
commonly come into use, and is effected by passing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">» 59 «</a></span>
it through small steel rollers, hardened and
polished. The object of this is soon manifest, as
the labour-saving process is brought prominently
into play: the wire in the first place need not be
so finely drawn, and secondly the same filigree
surface can be made to appear upon the articles as
before, by securing the edges of the wires which
show the filigree uppermost; and this is always
the case in manipulating with this kind of wire.
This method is generally in vogue with most
filigree workers.</p>

<p>A third plan of preparing the material for the
manufacture of filigree work is, we believe, due to
the ingenuity of a celebrated Birmingham firm,
who extensively practised this kind of work some
years ago. The secret is not now generally known
to the trade, therefore a few observations bearing
upon it will not be unacceptable to those for whose
benefit we are writing. The process is commenced
in the same manner as before, in the preparation
of the round wire, though this need not be drawn
so fine, because by this method we have no twisting.
When the round wire has arrived at the
proper size it is flattened in the manner already
explained; and when this is done it should be
annealed, but experience will dictate best when
this particular process should be carried out.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">» 60 «</a></span>
After this latter operation the wire is submitted to
the action of very small rollers, and bearing the
pattern required in small grooves of various sizes.
The pattern takes effect upon the edges of the
wires only, and resembles the milled or serrated
edges of our coinage, only of course the latter
bears no comparison with regard to fineness.
Lastly, the wire is again passed through the
flattening rollers, and then it is ready to be worked
up into the object desired.</p>

<p>Having gone through the general details of
filigree working we shall next direct our attention
to the component parts and commercial uses of
the English standards, together with those of some
other countries. In England there are two silver
standards, called respectively the old and the new
standards. They are as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>Fine silver per lb. troy.</p>

<table summary="standards">
<tr>
  <td class="tdl">Old Standard,</td>
  <td class="tdr">11 oz.</td>
  <td class="tdr">2 dwts.</td>

  <td class="tdl">New Standard,</td>
  <td class="tdr">11 oz.</td>
  <td class="tdr">10 dwts.</td>
  <td class="tdl2">= 959 millims.</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>The older of these appears to have been always
the legally recognised standard for the coinage,
and also for the manufacture of plate. By a law
passed, however, in the reign of William III. (1697)
it was raised to 11 oz. 10 dwts. of fine silver in the
pound troy weight. The manufacture of silver
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">» 61 «</a></span>
articles from this standard was soon found to be
not so durable as those made under the older one;
consequently the silversmiths were permitted by a
law passed in the reign of George III. (1819) to
manufacture from the former standard of 11 oz.
2 dwts., the use of the new one being likewise
permitted for the benefit of those who chose to
avail themselves of it; and to this day it remains
an English standard, though hardly ever employed.</p>

<p>By the Silver Coinage Act (10 Geo. 5), the fineness
of the British coinage was reduced on account
of the increased price of silver bullion; and the silver
coinage now consists of one-half silver, one-half
alloy, one troy pound of silver being coined into
sixty-six shillings. The copper which composes the
alloy in the silver coinage hardens the material
employed, and it is found to wear better.</p>

<p>In order to make the matter as simple as
possible, we purpose giving a few practical alloys,
as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>Old standard silver alloy, cost 4<i>s.</i> 4<i>d.</i> per oz.</p>

<p>If it is intended that the above alloy should be for
Hall-marking, it will be advisable to add a little
extra silver to the prepared composition, because
fine silver purchased from the refiner or bullion
dealer is never absolutely pure, consequently the
work will not pass the Hall; or better still alloy as
follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>The qualities of the silver employed by the
English silversmiths are invariably below the
standard, the duties, assay charges, and loss of
time in sending the work to the Hall to be marked
acting as a great drawback to the trade in the
midst of the keen competition of the present day.
Silver chains, brooches, buckles, collarets, &amp;c. are
for the most part manufactured from inferior metal.
In fact, some manufacturers positively refuse to
make Hall-marked goods, on account of the great
drawbacks attending the marking.</p>

<p>The alloys of silver are not calculated on the
carat system, like gold, but by certain numbers,
or other distinctive features, well understood by
the particular firms which trade in silver wares.
For our present purpose it will be sufficient to
distinguish them by using the numerals, 1, 2, 3,
4, &amp;c.; the alloy nearest approaching sterling or
standard we shall call No. 1, and so on downwards
until the lowest quality has been reached.
We may state that silver does not lose its whiteness
if not alloyed below equal quantities of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">» 64 «</a></span>
two metals; however, the alloys used in manufactures
seldom reach so low a limit.</p>

<p>The qualities of the silver alloys have been reduced
in this list to various values, and the latter
ones are as common as it is possible to make
them, without a great and perceptible change of
colour taking place in the prepared material. But
if it be desired to work a still more inferior metal,
then another ingredient must enter into its composition,
in order to keep up the whiteness of the
silver; and this other metal employed is nickel,
the alloys with which we shall have occasion to
refer to hereafter. Suffice it to say, however, that
these inferior alloys of silver, prepared with nickel,
are not now much employed by silversmiths in their
art-manufactures. It will be observed that we
have recommended the employment of <i>shot</i> copper
in the manufacture of silver alloys: we do so for
two reasons&mdash;first, because it can be purchased at
a considerably cheaper rate than can the ordinary
forms of copper, costing only one shilling per lb.,
whilst the ordinary prepared copper for alloying
will cost double that amount; and, secondly, if
proper attention has been given to the melting and
casting process, the workable qualities of the metal
will be found everything that could be desired.
Therefore an excellent material in all respects
can be produced by the means suggested at half
the cost of alloy. A considerable saving to a large
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">» 69 «</a></span>
firm might thus be easily effected by its employment.</p>

<p>In France there are three silver standards&mdash;two
to be employed by silversmiths, and one for the
coinage, as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>Fine silver per lb. troy.</p>

<p>It will be seen from the above table that pre-war
coinage in France did not represent the highest
standard, and also that their principal one was
inferior to our highest standard. French coinage
contained 36-40ths of fine silver and 4-40ths of
copper alloy, or millesimal fineness 900 parts of
fine silver and 100 parts of copper per 1,000 parts
of metal; the highest standard for silver wares
contains 38-40ths of fine silver and 2-40ths of
copper alloy, or millesimal fineness 950 parts of
fine silver and 50 parts of copper per 1,000 parts
of metal; the lowest French standard for silver
wares contains 32-40ths of fine silver and 8-40ths
of copper alloy, or millesimal fineness 800 parts of
fine silver and 200 parts of copper per 1,000 parts
of metal. The remedy is millesimal fineness 0&middot;005.</p>

<p>In the preparation of these alloys with French
silver it is undesirable to make any addition of fine
silver, in order to enable goods manufactured from
them to pass the Hall in safety, because the former
is assayed before it leaves the bullion dealers, and
the bars of metal are marked with their various
standards. Such is not the case in England, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">» 71 «</a></span>
refiners' fine metal is sometimes two or three grams
under what it is supposed to be; hence the necessity
for the further addition of some fine metal as
we have already pointed out, when the object in
view is to have goods Hall-marked; without which
addition it cannot be effected.</p>

<p>In Germany there are four silver standards&mdash;one
for the coinage, and three to be employed in the
manufacture of silversmiths' wares; and in that
country the various standards are severally applied
in the production of fine filigree and other artistic
work. The fineness of the standards is as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>As regards the alloy to be employed in the

<p>Soldering as applied to silversmith&rsquo;s work is an
art which requires great care and practice to
perform it neatly and properly. It consists in
uniting the various pieces of an article together at
their junctions, edges, or surfaces, by fusing an
alloy specially prepared for the purpose, and
which is more fusible than the metal to be soldered.
The solder should in every way be well
suited to the particular metal to which it is to be
applied, and should possess a powerful chemical
affinity to it; if this be not the case, strong, clean,
and invisible connections cannot be effected,
whilst the progress of the work would be considerably
retarded. This is partly the cause of
inferior manufactures, and not, as frequently supposed,
the want of skill in the workman.</p>

<p>The best connections are made when the metal
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">» 75 «</a></span>
and solder agree as nearly as possible in uniformity,
that is, as regards fusibility, hardness,
and malleability. Experience has proved, more
especially in the case of plain and strong work
(or work that has to bear a strain in the course
of manufacture), that the soldering is more perfect
and more tenacious as the point of fusion of the
two metals approaches each other; the solder
having a greater tendency to form a more perfect
alloy with the metal to which it is applied than
under any other conditions. The silver or other
metal to be operated upon by soldering being
partly of a porous nature, the greater the heat
required in the fusion of the solder the more
closely are the atoms of the two metals brought
into direct relationship; thus greater solidity is
given to the parts united, and which are then
capable of forming the maximum of resistance. It
is thus obvious that tin should not be employed in
forming solders possessing the characteristics we
have just described, for being a very fusible metal
it greatly increases the fusibility of its alloys; but
when very <i>easy</i> solder is required, and this is sometimes
the case, especially when zinc has been
employed in the preparation of the silver alloy, its
addition is a great advantage when it comes to be
applied to the work in hand. Solders made with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">» 76 «</a></span>
tin are not so malleable and tenacious as those
prepared without it, as it imparts a brittleness not
usually to be found in those regularly employed by
silversmiths; for this reason it is advisable to file
it into <i>dust</i>, and apply it in that state to the
articles in course of manufacture.</p>

<p>The best solders we have found to be those
mixed with a little zinc. These may be laminated,
rolled or filed into dust; if the latter, it should be
finely done, and this is better for every purpose.
Too much zinc, however, should not be added under
any conditions, as it has a tendency to eat itself
away during wear, thus rendering the articles
partly useless either for ornamental or domestic
purposes earlier than might be anticipated. Solders
thus prepared also act with some disadvantage
to the workman using them, for they possess
the property of evaporating or eating away during
the process of soldering, leaving behind scarcely
anything to indicate their presence; consequently
the workman has to keep on repeating the process
until the connection is made perfect, which is
always done at the expense of a quantity of solder
as well as loss to the workman as regards time.</p>

<p>Solders made from copper and silver only are,
generally speaking, too infusible to be applied to
all classes of silversmith&rsquo;s work.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">» 77 «</a></span></p>

<p>Solders are manufactured of all degrees of hardness;
the hardest of all being a preparation of
silver and copper in various proportions; the next
being a composition of silver, copper, and zinc;
and the easiest or most fusible being prepared
from silver, copper, and tin, or silver, brass, and
tin. Arsenic sometimes enters into the composition
of silver solders, for promoting a greater
degree of fusion; and we have heard of workmen
actually refusing to work with any other solder.
The employment of arsenic has, however, a tendency
to slightly endanger the health of those
persons using it in large quantities; and of late its
employment has not been persevered in.</p>

<p>In applying solder of whatever composition it is
of the utmost importance that the edges or parts to
be united should be chemically clean; and for the
purpose of protecting these parts from the action
of the air, and oxidation during the soldering
process, they are covered by a suitable flux, which
not only prevents oxidation, but has also a tendency
to remove any portion of it left on the parts
of the metal to be united. The flux employed is
always borax, and it not only effects the objects
just pointed out, but greatly facilitates the flow of
the solder into the required places. Silver solder
should be silver of a little inferior quality to that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">» 78 «</a></span>
about to be worked up. The various degrees of
fusibility of the several solders are occasioned by
the different proportions of the component parts of
the elements which enter into their existence.
For instance, a solder in which tin forms a component
part will flow or fuse much sooner than
one in which copper and silver alone enter into
composition, or of one wholly composed of copper,
silver, and zinc, or of silver and brass; therefore it
must be understood that tin is the best metal for
increasing the fusibility of silver solders, and for
keeping up their whiteness. Nevertheless it should
always be used sparingly, and even then drawbacks
will present themselves such as we have
already alluded to.</p>

<p>It is our intention to give a list of the various
solders which have been usually employed with
more or less success, so that the silversmith and
the art workman will be enabled to select the one
most suitable to the particular branch of his trade;
and we contend, from experience in the craft, that
success of workmanship mainly depends upon this
point.</p>

<p>The silver solders here given are not such as we
can confidently recommend to the general silversmith,
having proved them to be very unsatisfactory
in certain classes of work. For example,
the first solder, except in the case of plain strong
work, would be far too infusible to be generally
used by the silversmith; the second, although
much more fusible, cannot safely be applied to very
fine and delicate wire-work, because the brass in
its composition is so uncertain: unless specially
prepared by the silversmith, it probably, if purchased
from the metal warehouses, contains lead;
the latter is injurious, and in process of soldering it
burns and eats away, much resembling the application
of burnt sawdust to the work. No really
effective work can be produced when the above
symptoms present themselves. The same remarks
apply to No. 3, which is the most fusible, and
when free from lead or other base metal it may
be classed as a tolerably fair common solder.
In the preparation of the solders to which we are
alluding, it is preferable to employ, instead of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">» 81 «</a></span>
brass, a composition consisting of a mixture of
copper and zinc, in the proportion of two parts
of copper to one part of zinc; the operator then
knows of what the solder is composed, and if it
should turn out bad he will partly know the cause,
and be able to supply a remedy.</p>

<p>The solders that we have found to answer our
purpose best are composed of the following
elements. The first is described again as <i>hard</i>
solder, but it is not nearly so hard as the one
previously described.</p>

<p>The whole of the above-named solders will
bleach or whiten properly if applied to silver of the
suitable quality for such purposes. We have used
copper and spelter in our silver solders, because
we have found from experience that the fewer
number of times a solder is melted the better it is
for all purposes. This result of our experience is
in direct opposition to those authors who have
professed to treat upon this subject, and who can
have had but a small amount of real practical
knowledge, for it is argued by them that the
oftener a solder is melted the more properly does
it become mixed, and, consequently, the more fit
is it for the workman&rsquo;s use. To such arguments
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">» 84 «</a></span>
we are prepared to give a blank denial, and our
reasons for so doing we will state further on in this
treatise.</p>

<p>There are various other silver solders used by
silversmiths; some few of which it will be as well
perhaps, while we are on the point, to enumerate:&mdash;</p>

<p>The solders here given will be found amply
sufficient to select from, for every operation of the
silversmith, and will answer the several purposes
for which they have been described. When tin
and arsenic are employed in the composition of
solder, either together or separately, they should
be withheld until the more infusible metals with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">» 88 «</a></span>
which they are to be united have become melted;
the tin or tinsel should then be added, and when
this is well melted with the mass, fling on the top
the arsenic, let it melt, stir it well together, and
pour it out quickly into an ingot mould already
prepared for its reception.</p>

<p>When silver and brass, or silver and composition,
alone form the component parts of the solder,
these metals may be put into the melting-pot
together, well fused, stirred, and poured out as
before.</p>

<p>Solders into which volatile metals enter, upon
repeated meltings, become hard, brittle, and drossy,
and are therefore not so good as when the metal
has received only one melting; it is for this reason
that we have always preferred to manufacture our
solders from metals which have not been melted
before, or from those which have gone through the
process as few a number of times as possible.</p>

<p>The mode of soldering gold and silver is as
follows: Take the solder and roll it out thin
between the flattening rollers, or file it into dust,
according to the kind of work in hand. If filed into
dust, it is all the better if done very fine; and if
reduced to a flat state, which should be tolerably
thin, cut it into little bits, or pallions, which may
easily be performed with a pair of hand-shears,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">» 89 «</a></span>
length-ways and afterwards cross-ways. When
this is done, take the work which is to be soldered,
join it together by means of fine binding-wire
(very thin iron wire), or lay it upon the pumice so
that the joinings can come close together, and will
not be liable to move during the process; wet the
joinings with a solution of borax and water, mixed
into a thick paste, applying it with a small camel-hair
pencil; then lay the bits or pallions of solder
upon the parts to be united, and having placed the
article upon some
suitable object,
take your blowing
instrument
(<a href="#fig_16">Fig. 16</a>) and blow
with it, through
a gas-jet, a keen flame upon the solder in order to
melt it; this will render the unification of the parts
complete and compact.</p>

<div class="fig_center" style="width: 440px;">

<span class="fig_caption">Fig. 17. Solder-dish.</span>
</div>

<p>When filed solder is used, the process of charging
the article is rather different from the above. In the
latter case the filings are commonly
put into a small cup-shaped
vessel (<a href="#fig_17">Fig. 17</a>), in most
cases the bottom of a tea-cup, or
some other similar vessel, being
used for the purpose; a lump of borax is then taken
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">» 90 «</a></span>
and rubbed upon a piece of slate, to which a little
water is occasionally added during the rubbing;
when this solution attains the consistency of cream,
it is put into the solder-dish and well mixed with
the solder. This is then applied to the article to be
soldered, by means of a charger, consisting of a piece
of round metal wire, flattened at one end, and shaped
for the purpose it has to serve. The joinings, when
this kind is employed, require no boraxing with
the pencil, as described under pallion solder; the
borax being intermixed with the solder flushes with
it through the joinings to be united, thus rendering
any further application unnecessary. The process
to which we are alluding is called &ldquo;hard soldering,&rdquo;
and cannot be applied to metals of a fusible
nature; neither must it be attempted in the case of
goods bearing the name of plated, which are put
together with soft or pewter solder, similar to that
used by tinsmiths and gasfitters. If there should
be any soft solder about the article, to be soldered
by the means we are describing, it would be almost
certain to destroy it, the soft solder having such an
affinity for entering into combination with metals
more infusible than itself when overheated.</p>

<p>There is an art in soldering greater than some
people would believe. The heat required is of various
degrees, some articles requiring a broad rough
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">» 91 «</a></span>
flame, others a smooth one, and others again a
fine pointed one. All these circumstances connected
with the process, together with others which we
could detail, proving that it is an art only to be
acquired by practice, must be considered enough;
and we proceed to observe that the skilful jeweller in
soldering a large piece of work will direct the flame
of the gas jet to all parts of it, until it is tolerably
hot, and then return to the spot to be soldered,
and by a very dexterous movement of the flame,
produced by the blow-pipe, increase the heat at that
spot until the solder has flushed and the parts are
rendered thoroughly secure. So far as some of the
work of the silversmith is concerned, the process of
soldering is a very delicate operation, and ought
not to be undertaken by an unpractised hand.</p>

<p>The method of preparing solder for filigree work
is worthy of a passing notice. It is called by the
Germans Lemaille solder. In the first place it is
reduced to very fine filings, mixed with burnt borax
powdered fine, and in this state it is sprinkled
from a spouted grater over the work to be soldered.
The English filigree workers commonly
use clean filed solder, and by means of the camel-hair
pencil apply a solution of borax to the work,
and then sprinkle the dry solder upon it from the
grater.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">» 92 «</a></span></p>

<p>In Vienna a kind of powdered borax is employed,
called <i>Streu borax</i>, or sprinkle borax. It is composed
of the following ingredients, which should be gently
annealed to expel their water of crystallization, the
whole well pounded and mixed together, and
sprinkled over the parts to be joined from the
spouted grater as before:&mdash;</p>

<p>The object of this mixture is to prevent the rising
of the solder, and to facilitate its flushing. Too
much of it should not, however, be put with solder
in the grater at one time, as it is as objectionable
as too much borax applied in the ordinary way,
but every workman will learn from experience
concerning these matters. We have tried this mixture,
prepared with filed solder in the ordinary way,
and found it advantageous at first; but its greatest
drawback is the turning of the solder yellow if not
quickly used upon the work after mixing, thus
rendering the solder permanently injured. For
this reason we have had to abandon its employment
in the wet state. But, in its dry state, to the
silversmith for filigree purposes it is likely to be of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">» 93 «</a></span>
advantage. It may be remarked that this preparation
encumbers the work with a great deal more
flux than borax does, and consequently it requires
to be more often boiled out during the period of
soldering together the component parts. This is
effected by boiling in a weak pickle of sulphuric
acid and water, composed of the following proportions:
one part of acid to thirty parts of water.</p>

<p class="caption3">On the Melting of Silver.</p>


<p>The processes of melting and properly mixing silver
with its alloys in a crucible are among the first
operations of the silversmith, and are, moreover, of
great importance in the production of intimate and
homogeneous alloys. In order to effect these, however
simple they may appear, various precautions
are necessary, and certain principles require carrying
out to arrive at the best possible results,
otherwise a great loss or waste of material may
take place. To direct attention to those principles,
which from very careful attention to the subject
we have found to answer best, will first be our
aim, and if we succeed in rendering some little
service to our fellow-workers in the craft to which
our toil and leisure have been devoted we shall
feel highly gratified.</p>

<p>The weighing of the component metals, the
selection of the crucible, the charging of it, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">» 95 «</a></span>
the attention it requires whilst in the furnace are
considerations to which we cannot too strongly
call attention. The regulations with regard to
weighing should be strictly and accurately carried
out. The best and safest plan is, after the various
metals have been separately weighed, to re-weigh
them, this time collectively, in order to ascertain
whether the total weight corresponds with the
previous calculation; if it does, the mixture has
been properly prepared. We have known both
time and trouble saved by the adoption of this precaution,
after mistakes had occurred which could
not have been detected until the weighing of the
bar of metal had taken place after melting. There
are various kinds of crucibles manufactured for the
use of the precious metal workers. Crucibles were
so-called from originally being impressed by the
alchemists with the sign of the cross. They are
calculated to bear very high temperatures, and
consist of English, Hessian, Cornish, Black-lead,
and Plumbago. The last two are by far the best;
the plumbago, however, being the hardest, and
capable of standing the highest temperature, is to
be preferred before all others. It will also stand
more frequent meltings than any of the rest. Such
crucibles have been known to withstand the heat
of the furnace for upwards of fifty times without
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">» 96 «</a></span>
giving way. The wear of them is very strong and
resisting, as they only <i>gradually</i> become reduced
in thickness, so that it is easy to distinguish their
unfitness for use. Fluxes act on earthern crucibles,
particularly English at a high temperature, whilst
nitre and carbonate of soda soon destroy them.</p>

<p>Fluxes are necessary in most cases of metallic
reductions: they protect the metal from the air,
and dissolve impurities. They are of several kinds,
as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p class="p0" style="margin-left: 4em;">
Vegetable charcoal.<br />
Carbonate of potash.<br />
Carbonate of soda.<br />
Common salt.<br />
Sal-ammoniac.<br />
Sal-enixum.<br />
Saltpetre.<br />
Borax.<br />
Sandiver.<br />
Yellow soap.<br />
Black flux.<br />
White flux.<br />
Crude tartar.<br />
Brown potash.<br />
Sub-carbonate of potash.<br />
</p>

<p class="p0">All these fluxes have occasional duties to perform,
and are therefore of great service to the metallurgist.</p>

<p>To prevent the cracking or flying of the crucible,
when newly employed, it should, before being
charged with the precious metal, be well annealed;
that is, heated to redness upon a very slow fire&mdash;one
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">» 97 «</a></span>
that is gradually going down, and in which there
is no blaze is to be preferred, because the flame
has a tendency, on the introduction of a new crucible,
to make it fly to pieces. When it has become
red hot, if a cold bar of iron be introduced it will
soon show whether there are any cracks, and if
so the crucible should be rejected; on the contrary,
if it withstands this test it may be placed aside
until required for use, when it may be employed
with perfect safety in the melting of silver and its
alloys.</p>

<p>When copper and silver only form the alloys of
the silversmith, they should both be added to the
crucible at the commencement of the operation;
and it is the best plan to put the copper at the
bottom, because it is the most infusible metal. By
doing so, it will receive the greatest degree of
heat, which in jewellers' furnaces always comes
upwards and the higher specific gravity of the
silver has a tendency to force that metal downwards;
consequently, when the two metals have
become fused, upon well stirring&mdash;which should be
done with an iron stirrer tapered at the point, and
previously heated to redness&mdash;a perfectly homogeneous
mass will be the result. When the more
fusible metals of which we have spoken are to
form the component parts of the mixture, different
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">» 98 «</a></span>
treatment with regard to them will be required.
They should not be added at the commencement of
the operation, but should be dealt with afterwards,
in the following manner:&mdash;</p>

<p>Zinc is one of the more fusible metals, and is
sometimes employed by the silversmith in his
alloys, for the purpose of imparting a greater
degree of whiteness to them, as well as rendering
inferior silver more easily bleached or whitened;
thus assisting to bring back the natural colour of
fine silver to manufactured articles, which have
partially lost it by the addition of alloy of some
other colour. Zinc, when employed in silver
alloys, should be cautiously used, and care should
be taken not to add too much to a given quantity
of material. The solder used with silver-zinc
alloys should be far more fusible than that employed
with the other alloys. If too much zinc be
added in the preparation of these alloys, in the
course of the work, particularly in the process of
soldering, they have a tendency to <i>sweat</i>, and sometimes
to <i>eat</i> the metals into holes around the parts
to be united; such alloys, therefore, render this
process very difficult to perform, besides entailing
more labour in the production of a clean and smooth
finish.</p>

<span class="fig_caption">Fig. 18. Plumbago Crucible for melting.</span>
</div>

<p>In melting an alloy of silver, copper, and zinc,
the silver and copper should first be melted in a
plumbago crucible of the form shown in <a href="#fig_18">Fig. 18</a>,
and well stirred together in order that they
may become properly mixed.
The zinc is sold in flat
cakes under the name of spelter,
and, when required, is
usually cut up with a chisel
into pieces of various weights
suitable for the object in view.
When the copper and silver
have become well incorporated,
the mixture should be protected
from the air by a
suitable flux, charcoal being the best for this purpose.
The most suitable time to add it to the
crucible in the furnace is when the metals are
just beginning to fuse. This flux covers the
whole of the surface of the molten mass, and so
prevents the action of the air from destroying some
of the baser metal. The charcoal should be perfectly
pure and in a finely divided state, for if
adulterated with any gritty matter (and sometimes
such is the case) a very indifferent working material
is produced, the evil results of which show
themselves in every stage of manufacture. These
instructions with regard to melting the more infusible
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">» 100 «</a></span>
metals having been carried out, the zinc is
taken with a long pair of tongs (<a href="#fig_19">Fig. 19</a>), and held
within the furnace, over the mouth of the crucible,
until the temperature has almost reached the melting
point, when it should be carefully dropped into
the fused mass below, quickly stirred, so that it
may become intimately mixed with the other
metals, and at once withdrawn from the furnace
and poured into a suitable ingot mould (<a href="#fig_20">Fig. 20</a>).
The ingot mould should be clean
and smooth inside, slightly greased,
and dusted over with fine vegetable
charcoal; this latter substance
prevents the metal from
adhering to the sides of the mould.
It is, perhaps, almost unnecessary to state that the
ingot mould requires heating to a certain temperature
before the melted composition is poured in,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">» 101 «</a></span>
otherwise serious spouting takes place, resulting
in a great loss of metal. On the other hand, the
operator should be cautious not to over-heat it, as
the same evil consequences may result.</p>

<div class="fig_center" style="width: 582px;">

<span class="fig_caption">Fig. 20. Ingot Mould.</span>
</div>

<p>The bar of metal upon cooling should be
weighed, and the difference&mdash;as most meltings
show a little&mdash;noted. This is <i>loss</i>, but it will be
very little, if the above instructions have been
strictly adhered to from the beginning of the operation.
With the charcoal flux we have referred
to, very nice and clean bars of metal can be produced.
This flux is always floating upon the surface
of the mixture, and, with a little dexterity in
the pouring, it can be prevented from coming out
of the crucible with the metal; its proper place is
at the end of the pouring. When tin is employed,
either in alloys or solders, its treatment is similar
to that described for zinc; such alloys should not
be kept too long in the furnace after they have
become fused, as they rapidly become oxidized,
especially if brought into contact with the air.</p>

<p>The waste in silver, and in fact of all alloys, is
entirely dependent on the duration of the time of
fusion. If it is prolonged after the addition of the
fusible metals, the loss is greater in every case,
than when once melted. The metals should be subjected
to the beat of the furnace for the shortest
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">» 102 «</a></span>
possible period. The alloys of silver with zinc
would lose more than the alloys of silver with tin,
because zinc rapidly volatilises when heated above
the temperature of its fusion, and this is especially
the case when it enters into combination with
silver and copper in the fused state; its vapours
can be seen to rise and burn in the air, producing
light and white flaky fumes, and, chemically speaking,
forming the <i>protoxide</i> of zinc. With care and
manipulative skill during the process of fusion,
the proportion of waste can be reduced to a minimum;
and when this is exactly ascertained an
allowance can be made in the preparation of the
mixture for the crucible. From the above remarks
it will be apparent that when both tin and zinc
form component parts of a mixture, either to be
used as an alloy or as solder, the tin should be
added to the other metals, and well stirred, so as to
obtain an intimate mixture, before the addition is
made of the zinc.</p>

<p>Scrap silver should be carefully sorted before
undergoing the process of re-melting, and if possible
all foreign substances removed. It may, if
preferred to work it in that way, be melted into a
separate bar, or otherwise used as an addition to
a new mixture. When, however, it is separately
melted, a flux, such as carbonate of soda, may be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">» 103 «</a></span>
employed, on account of its cheapness, in small
proportions to the charcoal flux already alluded to.
In brittle and troublesome alloys we have found
charcoal and a small quantity of borax extremely
effective. Saltpetre is a very useful flux in dissolving
impurities, but in some alloys its presence
is injurious. Sandiver will remove iron or steel
from the mixture. Corrosive sublimate destroys
lead and tin. We have found the sub-carbonate
of potash one of the best fluxes for silver, when
matters have not been quite so straight as they
should be in the working of the metal; it is used
in melting the difficult alloy of 18-carat gold, and
is considered a secret not generally known to the
trade. Sal-ammoniac is an excellent flux for producing
clean and bright ingots and tough alloys.
We invariably use it with all our alloys, mixed in
small quantities with charcoal, and prefer it to all
others.</p>

<p>Lemel, that is the filings and turnings produced
during the process of manufacture, should have
quite a separate method of treatment. It is best
prepared for the crucible by passing it through a
fine sieve, afterwards thoroughly burning it in
an iron ladle, and then intimately mixing
it with a flux of the following nature and proportions:&mdash;</p>

<span class="fig_caption">Fig. 21. Fire-clay Crucible for Lemel.</span>
</div>

<p>The sal-enixum prevents the rising of the mixture
in the crucible&mdash;which should be of the skittle
shape (<a href="#fig_21">Fig. 21</a>)&mdash;and keeps it from overflowing; it
also possesses a refining capacity the same as saltpetre,
and is much cheaper.
The burning of the lemel has
a great tendency to destroy all
organic matter that would be
likely to cause the mixture to
overflow during the period of
fusion; but if such a thing should
be at all likely to take place,
the addition of a little dried
common salt would remedy the
evil, a small quantity of which
ought always to be provided for the purpose. The
common carbonate of soda is also a cheap and useful
flux to the silversmith. Five-sixths of the above
flux should be well mixed with the stated proportion
of lemel, then placed in the pot, and the one-sixth
remaining placed upon the top of the mixture,
when it may at once be transferred to the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">» 105 «</a></span>
furnace. Great heat is required in this operation,
and it also requires careful supervision to prevent,
if possible, waste of material. When the mixture
has become perfectly liquid, the heat of the furnace
should not be allowed to decrease, but continued
for half an hour longer, and if the use of it be not
further required, the fire may then be allowed
gradually to die out. The mixture will require
repeated stirrings during the period of fusion, in
order to dissolve such portions as might otherwise
not come immediately under the action of the flux.
When the operation of fusion has been completed,
the crucible is withdrawn and allowed to cool, the
solidification of the metal is then perfect, and it
may be recovered by breaking the pot at the base,
when it will fall out in a lump corresponding with
the shape of the crucible. The lump of metal
should then be carefully weighed, the loss ascertained&mdash;which
always varies in proportion to the
amount of organic matter contained therein; it
may then be sold to the refiner, or exchanged for
new metal.</p>

<p>In this process it will be observed that the
crucible is broken every time a fusion takes place,
consequently some little expense is incurred in
providing crucibles for the purpose. To obviate
which the following plan may be economically and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">» 106 «</a></span>
successfully employed; and especially when the
metal is sold to the refiner by assay, the method
about to be described will be found most advantageous,
for it should be borne in mind that the
lump of metal from the previous fusion has to be
again run down in another crucible and poured
into an ingot mould before the refiner will consent
to take his assay from it. In this latter process the
whole work is performed in one fusion, and the expense
of a new crucible thereby saved. The flux
employed in the reduction of the metal is also
considerably reduced. The plan
is performed after the following
manner:&mdash;</p>

<div class="fig_center" style="width: 240px;">

<span class="fig_caption">Fig. 22. Plumbago Crucible for Lemel.</span>
</div>

<p>Take a plumbago crucible of
the shape shown in <a href="#fig_22">Fig. 22</a>, and
capable of holding the required
mixture; put the lemel into it,
and then place on the top one
ounce of finely powdered carbonate
of soda; this is all the flux
the mixture requires, and it is
then quite ready for the furnace.
When the lemel has become properly fused, for
facilitating which it is repeatedly stirred with a thin
iron rod, it is withdrawn and poured into an ingot
mould prepared for it as previously described. The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">» 107 «</a></span>
flux and other organic matter, which always accumulates
upon mixtures of this kind, is held back by
the timely application of a thin piece of flat wood to
the mouth of the crucible. After the withdrawal of
the bar of metal from the ingot mould, it is cooled
and weighed, and then it is quite ready for the
operations of the refiner.</p>

<p class="caption3">On the Working of Silver.</p>


<p>Having reached a most important and very interesting
part of our subject, viz. the working
of silver, and being desirous of making this treatise
useful to the silver-worker in all the branches of his
art, it is our intention to enlarge upon these processes&mdash;which
are purely mechanical&mdash;and somewhat
minutely to describe the various manipulations
and arrangements required in the production
of the wares of the silversmith.</p>

<p>After the removal of the bar of metal from the
ingot mould, it should be plunged into a vessel
of cold water, dried, and then carefully weighed.
At this stage of the process it is ready for the
operation of rolling. This process, so far as it
concerns large ingots of the metal, is a distinct
branch of the trade, and is carried on in separate
premises established by certain firms for the purpose.
These establishments are called &ldquo;rolling-mills,&rdquo;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">» 109 «</a></span>
the machinery used in them (which is powerful
and costly) being moved by steam-power, the
reduction of the bars of metal to their various sizes
is soon effected. The very thin ribbon-shaped
metal is produced by submitting it to the action
of rollers of smaller dimensions, one after the
other, until the desired thinness is obtained. The
bars of metal are taken to these mills by a man
whose special duty it is to watch over them during
the processes of rolling and annealing, otherwise
it would be very easy to have an ingot of gold
or silver exchanged for one of base metal, the
mill companies not being responsible for the
material intrusted to their care for rolling; hence
the necessity for the porter&rsquo;s services, to watch
over his employer&rsquo;s interests. To prevent accidentally
exchanging the bars of metal, through their
great similarity to each other, it is the usual thing
for the men in charge of them to put a special mark
upon the property of each person, previous to the
process of annealing. This mark is applied by
means of a piece of chalk or soap, and is not
removable by heat. The annealing is performed
in large iron muffles, heated to redness and kept in
that condition by flues; the bars which require
annealing being placed upon a piece of sheet-iron
which slides into the muffle, and there they remain
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">» 110 «</a></span>
with the doors closed until they have become red hot.
It is more particularly during this operation
that each person&rsquo;s property requires marking and
watching, because of the number of bars admitted
at one time into the muffle; and unless the greatest
care be exercised at such a time some mistake is
almost sure to occur.</p>

<p>A register is kept of the weight of the metal
sent to the mill for the purpose of being rolled
into the required shapes and sizes by the manufacturer,
who afterwards works it up into different
wares and utensils. The metal is also weighed on
its admittance to the mill, by the clerk of the
works, and again on its passage out, and a comparison
of the weights registered; but in Birmingham,
in some cases, this has been so irregularly
performed that great discrepancies have actually
taken place in the weights at times, and it has led
to the establishment of another rolling-mill for
gold and silver, in which the proprietors take upon
themselves the whole responsibility and care of
metals intrusted to their charge for the above
purpose. The method pursued by them in respect
to their business is as follows: A manufacturer
sends a bar of metal to be rolled, carefully noting
the exact weight and size to which it is to be
reduced upon a proper <i>order head</i>. This weight
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">» 111 «</a></span>
is carefully tested at the mill, and if found correct,
an invoice is given in exchange, upon which is
entered the cost of rolling and the time when the
work will be completed. The messenger then goes
away, returning at the time stated to bring away
the rolled metal.</p>

<p>The advantages this system presents over the
others are obvious; the return of the full weight of
the metal is guaranteed by responsible persons, the
messenger is at liberty during the time occupied
in rolling to follow his other duties, the weighing
of the respective metals is far more accurately
performed both in and out of the mill, besides
greater satisfaction being given both to the manufacturer
and the roller, the reciprocation of confidence
between each, being among some of the
additional advantages which might be enumerated.
Messrs. Kemp, of Birmingham, deserve the thanks
of the jewellery community for their enterprising
efforts in the establishment of a system so admirably
suited to the requirements of the trade.</p>

<p>It is a usual thing at all rolling establishments
to provide slitting-rolls for those who choose to
avail themselves of that mode of cutting up their
metal. These rolls are used for the purpose of
cutting stout bars of metal into strips suitable
for wire-drawing, thus dispensing with the older
process of cutting with a pair of vice shears, which
method was slow and somewhat uncertain in the
production of good work. The slitting-rolls consist
of circular barrels, after the manner of the
&ldquo;breaking-down&rdquo; rolls, only of course much smaller
in diameter, and with this exception, the slitting-rolls
have square grooves cut into each barrel, the
projecting portion of each corresponding with the
hollow of the other, whereas the breaking-down
rolls are perfectly smooth and plain. Rollers something
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">» 113 «</a></span>
similar to those we have described are used
by wire-drawers to facilitate the speedy reduction
of the metal, the difference being in the construction
and action of the grooves. In the grooves of the
latter, which are inserted farther apart, the hollows
take a half-round shape, and unlike the slitting-rollers,
during the revolution of the barrels, the
grooves in this case directly meet each other, and
thus produce a strip of wire almost round. It is
almost needless to remark that wire-rolling requires
some amount of practical knowledge to perform it
properly. The manipulations indispensable to the
art of silver working are so varied and so numerous
that we are at a comparative loss which part
of the process to consider first; however, if we
follow the course of the workman with regard to the
production of the various manufactures of his art,
we shall perhaps not be far wrong in our desire to
effect the purpose we have in view.</p>

<p>In commencing to enlarge upon these mechanical
processes we may at once state that it is our
intention to refrain from going into the whole art
of wire-drawing, because that process has been
somewhat minutely alluded to in our other work
recently published in the interests of the goldsmiths;
the details of which are there fully
described.</p>

</div>

<p>The draw-plate, <a href="#fig_23">Fig. 23</a>, which is the principal
tool of the modern wire-drawer, was unknown in
this country until the middle of
the sixteenth century, when it was
introduced by Christopher Schultz,
a Saxon, from France. It was supposed
to have been the invention of a native of that
country named Archal. The draw-plate had been
in use some years on the Continent previous to its
introduction into England. The old method of
making wire was upon the anvil, by means of the
hammer; and those who manipulated in this art
were termed wiresmiths at that period. The best
form of draw-plate consists of a piece of steel
about nine or ten inches long, one and a quarter
to one and a half inch broad, and about half an
inch thick, each containing a number of conical
holes of various sizes, becoming smaller in succession
until the last hole in the plate is reached,
when another plate, corresponding in size, having
smaller graduated holes, is employed, and the wire
drawn through it; and so on, until the proper size
has been obtained.</p>

<p>The drawing of stout pieces of wire is effected
very readily by means of the draw-bench (<a href="#fig_24">Fig. 24</a>),
and the thinner pieces, by the application of draw-tongs
(<a href="#fig_25">Fig. 25</a>), held in the hands of the operator,
and made to do service by swinging the body
backwards. Very fine wire is now drawn by
means of an apparatus called a <i>drum</i> (<a href="#fig_26">Fig. 26</a>),
revolving upon a perpendicular pin, the exterior of
which receives the wire and prevents it from
becoming entangled. When the end of the wire
has finally passed through the draw-plate, the
whole coil is carefully removed from the drum
(which is made slightly conical in form for facilitating
the process) and placed upon a skeleton
frame made to receive it (<a href="#fig_27">Fig. 27</a>); it is then in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">» 116 «</a></span>
proper form for its passage through the next hole
of the draw-plate.</p>

<p>In the production of very fine wire, the metal,
after passing a few times through the draw-plate,
requires annealing, as its fibres become so condensed
and hardened that it is impossible to
repeat the operation without some risk of the wire
breaking. For fine wire the annealing is repeated
five or six times during its passage through the
draw-plate; for stouter kinds the annealing need
not be so frequent. This process produces a scale
or oxide upon the surface of the wire, which
should be removed before the continuation of the
drawing takes place, which is generally done by
an immersion for a time in very dilute sulphuric
acid pickle; or its passage may be assisted
through the draw-plate by the application of some
lubricating substance, such as beeswax, or a mixture
of beeswax and oil, which enables it the more
readily to pass through it. In the progress of the
wire-drawing the holes have a tendency to become
enlarged; these are made smaller again, by repeated
blows upon the front of the plate with a
somewhat pointed hammer (<a href="#fig_28">Fig. 28</a>), and then
opened from the back with a tapered steel punch,
such as is shown in the woodcut (<a href="#fig_29">Fig. 29</a>).
The hardening and tempering of the punch is of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">» 117 «</a></span>
importance. A gauge-plate is used in all establishments
for the purpose
of determining the size of
the wire. The hammering
should not take place upon
a hardened draw-plate, as
it would fly to pieces: it is only those known as
soft which should receive such treatment;
and those, by a continual alteration
of the holes, gradually become hard
and require annealing at intervals.</p>

<p>Draw-plates for wire-drawing purposes
are mostly cylindrical in form, but they
are employed in various degrees of fineness
and in different shapes; such as oval,
oblong, half-round, square, fluted, star,
sexagon, triangular, and other complex
sections, for the production of corresponding
wires, all of which receive similar
treatment to that above described.</p>

<p>The process of wire-drawing, in connection
with the art of the silversmith,
is more particularly employed in the
manufacture of chains, in which branch a
very large quantity of silver is consumed.
This branch of the craft is almost a purely mechanical
one, but, nevertheless, there are some designs in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">» 118 «</a></span>
chains which require a considerable knowledge of
art for the proper execution of them. It is, however,
in &ldquo;wrought&rdquo; or hand-made work that true
art is made to play so conspicuous a part; for it
is here that perfect workmanship, together with
great skill and taste, are required in the manufacture
of an article. &ldquo;Wrought&rdquo; work was one of
the earliest productions of
the goldsmith and silversmith,
and it still remains
the true <i>artistic</i> method,
although it has been
superseded by others of a
less expensive character;
such as stamping, chasing, engraving, enamelling,
casting, &amp;c., to which the older processes of ornamentation
and decoration by means of hammering
have given place.</p>

<span class="fig_caption">Fig. 31. Sparrow-hawk.</span>
</div>

<p>Wrought work is produced by hammering and
soldering the various pieces or ornaments together;
and one of the very first things to be attended to
in the production of this kind of work is proportion,
a knowledge of which is indispensable to
true art-workmanship; for the piece of metal
which is to be operated upon by the hammer
should be of the proper size, so as to require none
to be cut off afterwards. Every portion of a design
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">» 119 «</a></span>
should be wrought out of the piece of metal separately,
and soldered in its proper place upon the
article in process of manufacture. When circular
forms have to be raised or flanged by the employment
of the hammer, as in the case of a raised or
flanged brooch &ldquo;bezil,&rdquo; the <i>modus operandi</i> is as
follows:&mdash;Take a piece of metal of the exact size
and shape, turn the two ends together from the
longitudinal direction, and unite them by soldering;
when this is done, the circular band of metal
is taken and flanged by means of the hammer and
a miniature anvil, placed upon a stout piece of wood
which the workman renders secure by placing between
his knees, the pressure of which retains it
steadily in its place during the various manipulations
performed upon it; this kind of tool is termed
a &ldquo;sparrow-hawk&rdquo;&mdash;a representation
of it is given
in <a href="#fig_31">Fig. 31</a>. The work is
effected by a series of blows
dealt with the hammer in
regular concentric circles,
the bezil all the time gradually
working round the
pointed end of the sparrow-hawk.
It requires great skill and practice to produce
the proper shape, and to keep all parts of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">» 120 «</a></span>
metal of equal thickness. The bezils may be
produced in this manner round or oval, as well
as other complex shapes; the hammering taking
place according to the shape required. When
raised or ornamental brooch bezils, such as concave
or convex patterns, are to be made, the means
adopted in their execution are somewhat more
complicated than the mode of flanging above alluded
to. A tool called a &ldquo;swage&rdquo; is employed,
which partakes of many forms, the pattern or ornamental
device which the metal is required to take
being the shape of the swage, or otherwise cut
upon it. The metal is easily raised to take the
proper design, by a very careful application of the
hammering process.</p>

<p>Sometimes in silver-working the form of the
object to be manufactured is of such a nature as
not to allow of the use of the swage tool, and this
is more particularly the case in the manufacture
of plate. Such things, for instance, as cups or
tankards which have raised ornamental surfaces,
and which have to be executed after the vessel is
roughly finished, require altogether a different tool
for the effecting of such purposes. The one commonly
employed in operations of this description
consists of a bent piece of steel, upon one end of
which is cut the device required; this end being
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">» 121 «</a></span>
turned up to the required height for raising the
design, and the other end being bent in an opposite
direction, which, when required for use, is secured
in a vice. The workman, in executing the design
upon the object in hand, places it upon the &ldquo;snarling-iron&rdquo;
(for such the tool is called) at the part
to be raised, and there holds it securely while another
man strikes the piece of steel at the top of
the angle, or just above where it is secured in the
vice, the reaction of the steel wire then throws out
the metal, in accordance with the device or pattern
cut on the end of it. Designs are only roughly
raised in this manner, the perfecting of them being
performed by the application of various kinds of
chasing tools. To prevent a change in the form of
the object undergoing this operation, it is filled
with a composition formed of pitch, resin, and
brick-dust, in the following proportions:&mdash;</p>

<p>The preparation of the cement is as follows:&mdash;Reduce
the brick-dust to a very fine powder, and
pass it through a fine sieve; then take the other
ingredients and melt them in an iron ladle or other
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">» 122 «</a></span>
suitable vessel over a slow fire, stirring them well
together; when this has taken place, the mixture
will present a thin liquid appearance, which is the
time for using the brick-dust. This should be
added in small quantities at a time, and well
stirred together, until the mass has become tolerably
thick. It is then poured out either upon the
floor, or into some suitable vessel provided for its
reception. While undergoing the operation of
chasing, the lower part of the object is preserved
from injury, by being laid on a sand-bag. The
illustrations, Figs. 32 and 33, represent the snarling-tool,
and its mode of application to the work of
the silversmith.</p>

<p>The progress of the silversmith&rsquo;s art, in conjunction
with the researches and discoveries in the
mode of working the precious metal during the past
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">» 123 «</a></span>
century, have wrought a great change both in the
style and manner of workmanship. Before the
period referred to, the gold and silversmiths' trade
was in its lowest possible condition; partly, no
doubt, on account of the war then raging on the
continent of Europe, and partly because the silversmith
at that time was not allowed to manufacture
articles of any standard inferior to that of the coinage
of 11 ozs. 2 dwts. Until the peace of Waterloo, few
people were busy but the gun-maker, and other
smiths who were able to work at similar occupations;
but with respect to most other trades, the
men did all they were capable of, in order to earn
their daily bread. If at that time the silver trade
had been specially cultivated, the art, as regards its
progress, would have met with many drawbacks,
as compared with the present time; the knowledge
of the workmen in the production of finished work
was not equal to that to be found upon the best
articles now manufactured. And although forbidden
by law to work in inferior metal, they would
have been incapable of effecting the beautiful surfaces
which modern articles of inferior quality are
made to present. The recent scientific discoveries,
both chemical and mechanical, that have taken
place during the last sixty or seventy years, have
wrought a great change in the general conditions,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">» 124 «</a></span>
as well as in the mode of the manufacture of silver
wares.</p>

<p>We have said that previous to the year 1815 all
was dark and obscure with the precious metal
worker, but from that period the work gradually
rose in artistic excellence, and the trade very slowly
improved; the cause of this no doubt being due, in
a great measure, to the security afforded as the result
of peace, and with it a revival of the industrial
occupations. With the increased industries of the
nation arose the pleasures and pastimes of the
people, and racing became a national sport. This
kind of pleasure soon led to an increase in the work
of the silversmith, in consequence of the demand
for racing cups, which gave opportunities for the
artistic excellence of design in their manufacture;
and the silversmiths who made them soon acquired
a prestige as Art-manufacturers. The demand for
work of that and a similar kind led to the employment
of regular designers and modellers, who
gradually improved both the designs and the work
in different parts of the country.</p>

<p>At the period of which we are speaking, polished
or burnished silver goods were most in demand,
the modern processes of surface finishing not being
then understood. The introduction of the French
style of work in filigree soon afterwards caused a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">» 125 «</a></span>
demand for that class of work; and the attention of
those in the trade was then turned in that direction
for a time, and others springing up, the silversmith&rsquo;s
and goldsmith&rsquo;s trade generally began to
assume a position of importance. This kind of
work required no polishing and very little artificial
finish; besides being exceedingly light in weight
and graceful in appearance. It required fine material
for its manufacture. In England filigree work
has been superseded by other processes, but in
India, and in other parts of the East, it is still
cultivated to perfection.</p>

<p>Silver and gold filigree is also manufactured in
the Ionian Islands, in Switzerland, and in some
parts of Germany and France, where labour is
cheap. In the two latter countries it is made from
a very inferior material to that used in India.
Silver filigree work in this country was soon found
not to answer all the requirements of modern
society, so far as regarded its utility, durability,
and cheapness; fashion therefore demanded something
different. It is worthy of remark that while
this class of jewellery in both gold and silver was
so much in vogue for ladies' wear, the old-fashioned
seals and keys had undergone a change, and the
chasing of them in representation of filigree ornamentation
had become the fashion for gentlemen&rsquo;s
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">» 126 «</a></span>
wear. The processes of the manufacture of filigree
wire and its mode of application to the work of the
artist, have been considered in a previous chapter,
further detailed information is therefore rendered
unnecessary.</p>

<div class="fig_left" style="width: 95px;">

<img src="images/fig34.png" width="95" height="84" alt="" />
<span class="fig_caption">Fig. 34. Die.</span>
</div>

<p>When filigree work was no longer used, the
fashion changed into &ldquo;stamped&rdquo; or &ldquo;struck-up&rdquo;
ornament. Small pieces of metal were struck-up
by means of the hammer and punch, or by the use
of the hand-press or stamp; in the former case a
lead cake would be prepared, composed of a
mixture of lead and tin, and upon it the various
ornaments would be produced from the flat metal,
corresponding with the pattern of the punch
employed for the purpose; in the latter a small die
(<a href="#fig_34">Fig. 34</a>) would be employed with the pattern sunk
upon it; this would have an aperture
through it, the dimensions of the off-side
being generally rather large, gradually
becoming smaller towards the front surface,
which takes the form, in general outline, of
the desired pattern. When the necessary blanks
have been cut out, another die and punch are
used, by which they are raised to their proper
shape. These tools should be firmly secured in
the press (<a href="#fig_35">Fig. 35</a>), otherwise they are likely to be
soon destroyed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">» 127 «</a></span></p>

<div class="fig_left" style="width: 252px;">

<img src="images/fig35.png" width="252" height="351" alt="" />
<span class="fig_caption">Fig. 35. Press.</span>
</div>

<p>The small ornaments thus raised were variously
arranged one upon another, until a design or
pattern was formed, which in every way appeared
very showy. Such articles suited the tastes of
the people at that time, and
still suits those who require
good weight for their money.
The same kind of thing existed
at that period in chains, and
being heavy-looking, and costly
in appearance, they attracted
attention and caused a demand.
Thus with the continual changing
of the fashions a new era
for the goldsmiths and silversmiths
of England began. They were beginning
to work in all sorts of qualities, with the manipulations
and finish of which they were becoming now
thoroughly conversant, and a demand springing up
for goods for purposes of exportation, encouragement
was given to the trade, which soon assumed
the position of a thriving industry.</p>

<p>The style of work that followed the &ldquo;struck-up&rdquo;
patterns was that of plain and solid silver-work,
well polished and whitened. This sprung up
about the period when coloured gold became the
fashion, and the mode of finishing it being somewhat
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">» 128 «</a></span>
similar, no doubt the demand arose as much
from the introduction of colouring as from any
other assignable cause. In the chain-maker&rsquo;s
branch of the art, a great variety of new patterns
came into existence at this period; chain bracelets
also began to be introduced; and altogether the
trade made rapid strides, and fast rose into a great
commercial industry. This kind of work has remained
more or less in fashion up to the present
time, and vast quantities of silver chains of the
plain and solid patterns are now being made in
Birmingham.</p>

<p>The silver trade seems to be an exception to the
general depression which now prevails in all
the other branches of the jewellery trade; the
fashion just now is for silver, which causes a
greater demand than is usual for goods manufactured
of that material. In a short time we
believe this fashion will undergo a change, and
then no doubt manufacturers who have taken
advantage of it to make large stocks will have
goods remaining upon their hands which they will
not be able readily to dispose of, unless at a
sacrifice; for it should be borne in mind, that to
keep a large stock of silver goods in a saleable
condition, and without a quick sale, considerable
expense is entailed above the cost of making, to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">» 129 «</a></span>
keep them in that condition, through their great
liability to become tarnished.</p>

<span class="fig_caption">Fig. 36. Hammer for dooming.</span>
</div>

<p>After the introduction of plain and solid-looking
work, it next became the fashion to have it chased
over its entire surface. Following this, about the
year 1825, came the beautiful process of enamelling,
which added artistic beauty to the work, and
brought out the harmonies of colour. About this
time, too, there sprung up a great demand for the
so-called &ldquo;galvanic ring,&rdquo; which consisted of a
lining of zinc and one of silver. The ring represented,
in appearance, those large, plain, half-round
rings which are now made in 18-carat gold,
and which weigh from 7 to 10 dwts. each. It was
then as now made of half-round shape, and sometimes
with the addition of a buckle upon it. The
silver was so drawn upon the zinc that the outer
surface appeared entirely of silver, and a portion
of the inner surface was made to show the zinc
only, which was quite sufficient for the purpose required.
When the ring was put on the finger the
zinc, in conjunction with the silver, touched the
flesh of the wearer, and was thus supposed to
create a galvanic action, which it was alleged had
a tendency to remove or prevent <i>rheumatism</i>.
This kind of work had a good run at the time of
its introduction, but like all the rest, the fashion
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">» 130 «</a></span>
lasted only for a while, when something else had
to be brought to the front in the silver trade. The
mode of the preparation of the wire was as follows:&mdash;A
bar of silver would be rolled out until a certain
thinness was attained, occasionally annealing it
during the process; it was
then cut into strips wide
enough for the purpose
required, again annealed,
and subsequently doomed.
The latter process was
effected in this manner:&mdash;A block of hard wood,
such as boxwood, would be made use of, having
a round groove in one side of it, the metal to
be doomed would be laid along the groove and
a round piece of iron or steel held upon the
upper surface with the left hand; a wooden
mallet is then taken with the right hand, and by
a skilful application of it to the piece of iron or
steel, the metal is soon forced down in the groove
and made to take the proper form for drawing.
The flat strip of metal should be pointed; this
may either be done before or after the dooming
process, though it commonly takes place before.
It is performed by taking away a small portion in
a conical form, from one of the ends with a pair of
hand-shears. A piece of zinc wire should be provided,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">» 131 «</a></span>
corresponding in shape with that the ring is
to take; this is placed in the hollow of the silver
to be drawn, with the flat side outwards, so as to
correspond with the aperture in the plate through
which it has to be drawn. A draw-plate is then
taken, with holes of the half-round shape, and the
two metals carefully drawn through them. The
drawing through a succession of holes produces
an edge upon the silver coming against the flat
side of the aperture in the draw-plate which overlaps
the zinc and thus holds it securely in its
place.</p>

<p>A change in the style of work gradually took
place in the course of every few years, and thus it
was that hollow-work became the fashion. This
kind could be made in a variety of ways, and
being very light and showy, it appeared much
more expensive than it really was. It is therefore
very easy to account for the changes which
have taken place in the manufacture of articles of
adornment and luxury, and for the encouragement
which the art has received. With the present
styles of the &ldquo;plain,&rdquo; the &ldquo;solid,&rdquo; the &ldquo;filigree,&rdquo;
the &ldquo;stamped,&rdquo; the &ldquo;mosaic,&rdquo; the &ldquo;cameo,&rdquo; the
&ldquo;repoussé,&rdquo; the &ldquo;inlaid,&rdquo; the &ldquo;enamelled,&rdquo; and a
variety of others, we can fearlessly say that silver-working
has of late years made rapid progress,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">» 132 «</a></span>
and attained to a higher standard than it ever
before possessed.</p>

<span class="fig_caption">Fig. 38. Stamping Press.</span>
</div>

<p>The art of stamping and shaping
articles of jewellery from sheets of
the various metals came into general
use just previous to the first Exhibition
in 1851. These, which are made
in considerable numbers, are produced by means
of dies, having the shape
of the pattern upon them,
both at the top and bottom,
made of hardened
steel. <a href="#fig_37">Fig. 37</a> represents
a bottom die for the use of
the stamping press, and
<a href="#fig_38">Fig. 38</a> represents the press.
In raising the metal by
stamping, the material undergoes
the same bendings
and extensions between the
dies as if it were being
manipulated by the hammer,
and consequently it
requires to be repeatedly
annealed, otherwise it
would crack and fall to
pieces in a subsequent operation. The raising
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">» 133 «</a></span>
should be brought about gradually, and this is done
by placing a number of sheets of metal between the
dies, which prevents the top die from falling with
too sudden an action upon the metal, which it
would do, as it falls with a succession of forces if
the process be repeated, and if its action be not
arrested by the means we have pointed out. After
every blow of the stamp one of these pieces is
removed from the bottom, and a fresh one added
at the top; the continual falling of the stamp
gradually forces these plates, if placed in the
manner we have indicated, to take the shape of the
die. The exact form of the figure is effected by
striking the plates singly between dies which
exactly correspond. A very large quantity of
work is now produced by the means we have
stated, such as brooches, studs, locket-backs, earrings,
rings, and an endless variety of other
things; moreover, by the cultivation of this art a
considerable amount of the labour formerly bestowed
by hand upon the work is now saved, as
the stamping in many instances is so complete,
almost taking the form of a finished article after
that process has been performed, that the workman
has only to arrange the parts and supply the
ornamentation when required, to render the article
complete.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">» 134 «</a></span></p>

<p>Works of art are also produced by other
methods; as an example, we will take the process
of &ldquo;spinning or burnishing into form,&rdquo; which
consists in spinning the metal to the desired shape
in a lathe, by means of burnishing tools, specially
made for the purpose. This process is employed
in the production of large bangle bracelets with
plain surfaces and other similar works. The metal
to be operated upon should be soft and malleable,
otherwise the process is very difficult to perform.
The disc, or other form of metal, is taken and fixed
in the lathe with the aid of holdfasts, a chuck or
mould of the desired pattern being provided, upon
which the disc is turned by the tools referred to.
The metal, as in the other processes, is <i>gradually</i>
spun into the required form. In most cases the
mould is exactly the shape of the interior of the
article required to be made, and under these circumstances
it would be made up in several pieces
together with a key-piece; so that when this latter
is taken away, there is no difficulty in removing the
rest, and leaving the article free. It is of importance,
during the spinning, to keep the edges free
from notches, but should these occur, it would be
better to touch them a little with a turning tool.
The metal for spinning into a bangle bracelet
should be of the form of a flat circular band,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">» 135 «</a></span>
soldered of course; it would then be secured upon
a properly shaped mould, composed of several
pieces, in the manner above described; this would
then be placed in the lathe, and the application of
the spinning tools would soon bring about the
desired form. After the removal of the spun piece
of metal, the workman trims the edges up a little,
then saws it into two pieces, and at once proceeds
to the operations of snapping and jointing, which
are delicate processes to perform properly in work
of this kind, and require the services of a skilled
and competent workman.</p>

<p>Having now described some of the processes in
the working of silver, and alluded to the various
articles which are produced by <i>wire-drawing</i>;
<i>raising</i> with the hammer; <i>stamping</i>; <i>spinning</i>;
<i>chasing</i>, &amp;c.; we shall next direct attention to those
processes which immediately come after the putting
together and soldering the article; and foremost
of these is <i>polishing</i>. We trust that the
foregoing details in reference to this part of the
subject will convey some idea of the art of silver-working.</p>

<p>Polishing is an important process With all precious
metal workers. It is applied for the production
of <i>surface</i> to their wares, and in proportion
to the smoothness required upon the work, so
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">» 136 «</a></span>
should be the fineness of the material employed
in effecting it. The polishing powders are <i>emery</i>,
<i>powdered pumice</i>, <i>crocus</i>, <i>rottenstone</i>, <i>putty of tin</i>, and
<i>rouge</i>. In the best work, scratches are removed
with a smooth and rather soft dark grey stone
(Water-of-Ayr stone); it is then polished in the
lathe with a stiff brush, and the application of a
little fine polishing mixture. We have placed the
materials for polishing in their respective order of
smoothness or fineness, beginning with emery,
which is the coarsest. A very good mixture for
ordinary work consists of equal portions of emery,
pumice, and crocus, with oil added to the consistence
of a thick paste. Good work does not want
much polishing, for the beauty of it depends <i>more</i>
on its being executed by a well-trained workman;
whereas rough and badly executed work
requires much polishing, and for this the coarser
powders are preferable, or a mixture of them; but
for the smoother work the finer powders should be
employed.</p>

<p>The Water-of-Ayr stone employed for polishing
is usually obtained in the form of small square
sticks, and is used with a small quantity of water
to the surface of the work, in a similar manner to
filing. The stone is softer than the material upon
which it operates (and, in fact, so are all the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">» 137 «</a></span>
materials for polishing), and therefore wears away,
producing a mud-like substance upon the article,
which should be repeatedly removed in order to
ascertain the progress made. This may be done
with a piece of clean rag, or tissue-paper. When
the work is polished at the lathe it will gradually
become enveloped in grease, &amp;c., which should be
removed occasionally, to show when the process
has been carried far enough. The polishing of
silver work is a branch of the trade commonly performed
by girls. It is hard work for them, as the
metal possesses a very soft nature; it therefore
pulls hard against the brush which holds the
polishing mixture. The lathe employed is the
ordinary polishing lathe with a horizontal spindle,
and is worked with a common foot-treadle; steam-power
is used by some firms for moving these
lathes, but it is by no means the usual custom at
present.</p>

<p>After the completion of the polishing process,
the work is well washed out in a prepared solution,
to remove the mixture which adheres to it; a solution
of soda is found to answer the purpose best,
both from its cheapness and effectiveness. It
should be used hot, with the addition of a little
soap, and with a stiff brush the dirt is soon removed.
The quantity of soda used to a given proportion
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">» 138 «</a></span>
of water differs in the trade, and there is no set
rule to go by; it depends, more or less, upon the
adhesiveness of the polishing mixture. We have
found about two ounces of it to a quart of water
amply sufficient for the purpose.</p>

<p class="caption3">Enriching the Surfaces of Silver.</p>


<p>By the application of the processes about to be described,
the finishing touches in their relation to
articles or wares of silver manufacture are effected.
These processes, as adopted by the trade, are
various, almost every firm having a specially prepared
mixture and mode of employing it. We
shall refer only to those which, from their practical
utility, are likely to be of service to those workmen
who have to do with this particular metal. The
branch of the art of which we are now treating
comes only into operation when every other process
of workmanship has been completed; and
some of these processes must be executed in a
perfect manner in order to arrive at the highest
possible results in this one. The best and richest
surface is produced when the metal to be operated
upon is good in quality, and the workmanship
of a fair order, so far as regards smoothness, and
freedom from surplus solder-marks.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">» 140 «</a></span></p>

<p>One of the oldest methods for producing a pure
snowy whiteness upon articles of silver was as follows:&mdash;Take
an iron or copper annealing pan (the
latter is much to be preferred), place the work upon
it in proper order, so that it may be heated all over
alike. It should, previous to this, be immersed in
a thick solution of borax, or otherwise brushed over
with it. After the work has been properly arranged
upon the pan for annealing, it must be sprinkled
over with fine charcoal dust; the pan is then
placed in the muffle upon a bright clear fire without
blaze, and when the work has assumed a degree
of heat approaching to cherry redness, it is withdrawn
and allowed to cool. When this has taken
place, it is removed and boiled out in a very weak
solution of sulphuric acid, commonly called oil of
vitriol. If the right colour was not then produced,
the process was repeated as many times as circumstances
permitted, though usually two or three
times was found to be amply sufficient. The
annealing process required great attention, for
the work being in contact with borax, if slightly
overheated, it was liable to become melted, therefore
the operation was a delicate one to perform,
and was only intrusted to such workmen as were
experienced in the art. Small delicate articles were
commonly treated with the mouth blow-pipe and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">» 141 «</a></span>
gas-jet, and were placed upon a pumice-stone, or
some other suitable substance capable of withstanding
the power of burning. According to the
inferiority of the silver alloy, is the difficulty of
producing a good white surface on wares of such
standards. Fine silver requires very little whitening,
generally one process suffices to effect a good
colour; but inferior standards require half a dozen
or more to bring up the proper degree of whiteness;
and those ranging below 9 oz. 12 dwts. to
the lb. Troy cannot be whitened at all by the
means we have described, but require the application
of the modern chemical process, known as
electro-plating.</p>

<p>The East Indian silversmiths never touch their
manufactures with any kind of abrasive substance,
from the most delicate, to the more strongly made
article. But then it should be remembered, that in
India the natives work from the pure material, a
point which they rigidly adhere to; whereas we are
compelled in this country to manipulate in all
sorts of qualities; and some of these require no
little trouble and difficulty to bring back to the
surface the snow-white appearance of the pure
metal. In the former case it is effected without
any difficulty whatever&mdash;in fact, the metal scarcely
undergoes any change throughout the whole of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">» 142 «</a></span>
the manipulations to which it is subjected in the
various processes of manufacture. The Indian
mode of procedure is as follows:&mdash;Some juicy
lemons are cut into slices; the silver articles are
briskly rubbed with these for a short time, and
subsequently covered with them, being placed in a
suitable vessel for a few hours for the completion
of the process. For very delicate articles of jewellery
the natives cut a large lime nearly in two
halves, into which they insert the work; the
halves are then tightly closed up again, and placed
aside for a few hours; when the article is removed,
it is well rinsed in clean water, and consigned to a
vessel of nearly boiling soap-suds, where it is well
brushed, again rinsed in fresh hot water, and
finally dried on a metal plate placed over hot
water; the process is rendered complete by a little
gentle rubbing with wash-leather if the work be of
a plain nature. Green tamarind pods are also
employed by them for the purpose of whitening
silver, in the same manner as just described; they
are great detergents both of gold and silver manufactures,
and are largely employed by artisans in
the East for the removal of oxides and fire-marks.</p>

<p>Another process for the whitening of silver
goods is performed in the following manner:&mdash;Take
the work, which must be cleanly prepared, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">» 143 «</a></span>
give it a coating of the following mixture:&mdash;Finely
powdered vegetable charcoal four parts, saltpetre
one part; the ingredients should be well mixed
with a little water, and may be applied to the
surface of the metal either by brushing over with a
soft brush, or by dipping the work into it. The
work is then placed upon the annealing pan and
submitted to the heat of the muffle, until the wet
powder has become perfectly dry and ceased to fly
about; it is then withdrawn from the muffle,
allowed to cool, and afterwards boiled out in a
solution of potash prepared for the purpose, in the
proportion of about one ounce of bi-sulphate of
potash to twenty ounces of water. The boiling
out is done in a copper pan
(<a href="#fig_39">Fig. 39</a>), and if the work be put
through the above process two
or three times a beautiful dead-white
colour is the result. It
is then washed in a hot solution
of soda, soap, and water, or if preferred bright,
scratched, or burnished, and the process is finally
completed by drying it in fine boxwood sawdust,
which should be made hot, but not allowed to char
or burn in any way, as it would produce a stain
upon the work very difficult to remove, and thus
the finish would be considerably impaired.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">» 144 «</a></span></p>

<p>In large manufactories the process of whitening
silver goods is repeatedly required to be performed,
and where such is the case, the above methods are
found not only tedious and expensive, but occupy
much unnecessary time and labour; to dispense
with a portion of which, the custom of covering the
work with a chemical preparation was accordingly
departed from, and yet it was made to show its
former brilliancy. To effect this object the liquid
for boiling it in was differently prepared, which
only required to be made of a proper strength to
do all that the surface mixture had done before.
The following is the method adopted in preparing
the cleansing liquid. Boiling-out mixture:&mdash;To
one pound of smoking salts, add two ounces of
cream of tartar; well shake the ingredients together,
so that they may be thoroughly incorporated.
The smoking salts employed for this
purpose are not the ordinary <i>spirits of salts</i> of commerce,
but a preparation of the common oil of
vitriol; therefore the one should not be taken for
the other; the spirits of salts would turn the work
black, whereas, if the proper ingredient were procured,
a fine dead matte or blanched surface would
be the result of its application. The mixture
employed for boiling the work in consists of the
proportion of one ounce of the above preparation
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">» 145 «</a></span>
to about thirty ounces of water. The silver articles
simply require to be annealed, allowed to cool,
and then boiled for a minute or so in this solution,
when the desired result will be attained; if, however,
the exact colour be not obtained the first time,
the process should be repeated a second, and if
necessary, a third time; the right colour will then
be produced, if the articles are not made of a too
inferior standard.</p>

<p>The mode we have ourselves adopted for the
colouring or whitening of silver goods is somewhat
different, and still more simple than even the
above. We will proceed to give the details of the
process. A mixture of very dilute sulphuric acid
is first provided, in the proportion of one ounce to
forty ounces of water, and well mixed together; the
work, after being heated to a good red heat, is
boiled in this, which soon removes the oxide from
the surface, and shows the fine white colour of the
pure silver. For fine silver work, such as Indian
filigree, one process will generally suffice, for
English standard quality two, and for low qualities
three, but these latter must not by any means
be too low; if so, no colouring can take place by
the method just described. Objects of delicate
workmanship are usually annealed by the gas;
being placed on a pumice-stone of light material,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">» 146 «</a></span>
the flame of the gas is blown with the mouth blow-pipe,
in such a manner that the object gradually
becomes heated all over alike; and the work
should be well heated, as this facilitates the process
of oxidation, and subsequently that of whitening.
The oxidation takes place at the expense of the
copper in the silver alloy, and this is only effected
by raising the articles to a very high temperature,
which produces the oxidation of the copper coming
in contact with the air, and which necessarily
exists upon the surface of the alloyed goods.
Whitening silver goods then is nothing more than
the removal of the base alloy from the surface,
leaving the pure metal behind with its full rich
colour. Therefore to be clear, the process of annealing
in contact with cold air oxidizes the copper
upon the surface, and the pickling mixture so
dissolves and removes it, that it gradually undergoes
a process of refining, and is ultimately made
to represent the finest material in all its purity.</p>

<p>Sometimes silver work is to be seen having a
brown colour upon it; this is produced when the
acid employed for cleansing has been too strong;
it can only be remedied by another annealing and
boiling-out in a much more diluted mixture. There
are various other methods employed in the trade
for the purpose of whitening silver work of the best
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">» 147 «</a></span>
quality; and although annealing is always a part
of the process, other ingredients, such as salt and
tartar, permanganate of potash, cyanide of potassium,
alum, &amp;c., have been severally used for the
cleansing or whitening mixture. They may be
useful in their application to plated work (articles
that have received a coating of pure metal by
means of the electro-metallurgical process), for
cleansing purposes only, but for all practical purposes
the process to which we have called special
attention is to be much preferred.</p>

<p>Common articles of silver cannot be whitened by
annealing and boiling-out in a diluted acid; a thin
film of pure silver must be deposited upon their
surface by the process of electro-deposition, or by
the action of some chemical preparation in which
fine silver forms the principal ingredient. Such
preparation, however, as the latter can be used only
to plain surfaces, therefore they are not applicable
to all kinds of work. They are composed of the
following chemical ingredients:&mdash;1st, chloride of
silver 1 part, cream of tartar 1 part; 2nd, chloride
of silver 1 part, common salt 1&frac12; parts; 3rd, chloride
of silver 1 part, prepared chalk 1 part, pearl-ash
1 part; 4th, chloride of silver 1 part, alum 1 part,
common salt 2 parts. The chloride of silver is
easily prepared by precipitating it from the nitrate
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">» 148 «</a></span>
with a solution of common salt or hydrochloric
acid. The various mixtures should be worked up
with water into a thin paste, and applied to the
work by rubbing with a soft cork or piece of wash-leather,
or by thoroughly stirring it about in the
mixture until it has acquired the requisite degree
of whiteness. For the purpose of silvering watch
and clock faces, &amp;c. these mixtures may be used
with advantage and entire success.</p>

<p>Other solutions are sometimes employed for
similar purposes and are very useful; being simple
in their preparation and easy of management. We
have selected the following as being the most
practical:&mdash;Take one ounce of the <i>nitrate</i> of silver
and dissolve it in one quart of pure distilled water,
or if this cannot be procured, water which has
been boiled, by which it loses some of its impurity.
When the nitrate of silver has become thoroughly
dissolved, throw into the mixture a little powdered
hyposulphite of soda, this will precipitate the
silver, and when it has taken place, a further
addition of hyposulphite of soda should be made,
which will eventually re-dissolve the precipitate,
and the solution is then ready for use. To produce
a good mixture, the salt of soda should be added
slightly in excess. The solution is used by simply
dipping a sponge in it and rubbing it over the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">» 149 «</a></span>
surface of the articles to be coated, and this is
continued until they have assumed the desired
colour.</p>

<p>For improving the colour of silver and electro-plated
wares, the following mixture has been
strongly recommended:&mdash;Nitrate of silver 4 pennyweights,
cyanide of potassium 5 ounces, and water
1 quart; the ingredients should be well mixed
together, and applied by means of a soft brush
or sponge to the surface of the work. In using
this cyanide solution, the operator should be careful
to guard against a too frequent contact with it,
as it is decidedly injurious to the hands, especially
if there be any abrasion of the skin; it being one
of the deadliest poisons known. Sufficient details
of the process of silver whitening and cleansing
having now been given to assist the workman who
manipulates in this particular metal, and to enable
him to select a form of recipe in every way adapted
to the kind of work in hand, we shall now proceed
to the modern process of <i>electro-plating</i>, and
give a practical description of it in its applicability
to the trade of the silversmith.</p>

<p>This art is decidedly of modern origin, as far
as concerns its employment for commercial purposes.
The invention is supposed to be due to the
electrical and chemical researches of Mr. Spencer,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">» 150 «</a></span>
of this country, and Professor Jacobi, of Russia,
both of whom claim to have found out the art of
depositing one metal upon another, somewhere
about the same period. Of course it was left to
others to apply the invention to the industrial arts,
and it was not until after the discovery of the
<i>Constant Battery</i>, by Professor Daniell, about half
a century ago, that the art began gradually to
extend in the direction of commercial pursuits.
The Messrs. Elkington, of Birmingham, were the
first to employ it in their manufactures, with a
success which their enterprise thoroughly merited.
This took place about the year 1840, and since
that time the art of electro-plating and gilding
has wonderfully developed, in its application to
the various manufactures of the country. Its progress
would be a subject highly interesting, were
we to trace the general details of it, but the part of
it we are considering being the practical mode of
its employment in manufactures, we shall at once
direct our attention to it, by giving a complete
description of the process; so that the ordinary
silversmith may be enabled to employ it in his
business with safety and advantage.</p>

<p>The first thing to be considered in electro-plating
is what <i>Battery</i> to employ, which will be
the most simple, inexpensive, and effective one.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">» 151 «</a></span>
When the battery is only occasionally required for
use we prefer the Smee before any other. It is
a small portable apparatus, and consists of a high,
but narrow, glass or stoneware jar, in the form of
a cylinder, capable of holding about two quarts;
inside this jar is fitted a thin plate of platinized
silver fitted to a frame with two zinc plates, one on
each side of it, the zinc plates being held to the
frame by means of a binding screw. Strong
copper wires are firmly secured to these screws,
which serve as the positive and negative poles of
the battery. Those parts of the plates which
are not exposed to the action of the acid solution
may be advantageously coated with sealing-wax
varnish or melted paraffin wax, to protect
them from the destructive influences of the battery
acid, and to prevent it from creeping upwards,
which destroys the connections. The jar is filled
with water acidulated with sulphuric acid, in the
proportion of 1 of acid to 20 of water; the frame
containing the plates is then lowered into the
solution, and the battery is ready for use. In
the above form of battery for occasional use we
have one simple in construction, easy of management,
of fair constancy, and when once prepared
very inexpensive, merely requiring a little free
acid at times to keep up the strength of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">» 152 «</a></span>
current. Two cells of this form of battery, each
holding two quarts of mixture, will be found sufficient
for all ordinary purposes. The zincs should
be well amalgamated, and not touch the bottom of
the cells. The connections should be regularly
examined, and kept perfectly free from corrosion,
which would stop the passage of the current.
For plating small delicate articles of jewellery one
cell of the above form will be found powerful
enough for the purpose.</p>

<p>The battery that we prefer and have of late
years employed, for regular continuous working,
is the Bunsen, consisting as before of a cylindrical
glass or stoneware jar of the same size and dimensions,
fitted with a well amalgamated <i>cylinder</i> of
zinc and a copper wire secured to it; a porous cell
is placed in the centre, and a bar or rod of carbon
is put into this cell with a copper wire also secured
to it. The porous cell is filled with a mixture of
equal parts of nitric and sulphuric acids, or sulphuric
acid alone; we prefer the latter, as it does
not give off such fumes as does the other acid; a
little of the more powerful acid, however, is sometimes
required to be added in order to increase the
action, as with this acid alone it sometimes
becomes slow. The outer cell is filled with a
mixture of 1 part of sulphuric acid to 20 parts of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">» 153 «</a></span>
water, and the connections being in proper order
the battery is then ready for use. In action this
form of battery is regular and continuous, it lasts
a long time upon one charge, and is therefore inexpensive
in use; if the two cells are coupled for
power or intensity, an unusual quantity of work
may be got through in a given time. This cell is
admirably suited to the work of the manufacturing
silversmith, and to those who prefer doing their
own plating.</p>

<p>The amalgamation of the zinc is effected as
follows:&mdash;The cylinders are best treated by putting
some mercury into a coarse flannel bag, dipped
repeatedly into muriatic acid and applied to the
surface of the zinc, both inside and out; and when
they present the bright characteristic appearance
of mercury they are sufficiently operated upon, and
may be rinsed and set aside to drain. The zinc
plates may be advantageously amalgamated by
placing some mercury in a shallow dish with a
little muriatic or sulphuric acid, a hare&rsquo;s foot or a
piece of cloth tied to the end of a stick is then
dipped into the mercury and acid, and rubbed over
the plates until they are sufficiently protected with
mercury, when they should be rinsed in clean water
and set aside to drain. If possible the process of
amalgamation should always be conducted in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">» 154 «</a></span>
open air, as the fumes which are given off, if
breathed, are highly injurious. The best possible
way to amalgamate rods of zinc is by pouring
mercury into the melted metal just before casting
it into rods, in the proportion of 1&frac12; oz. of mercury
to the pound of zinc. This makes the rods exceedingly
brittle, and they should therefore be
handled with care. The mercury should not be
added to the zinc when the latter is at too high a
temperature, and the best manner of testing this
is by the application of a piece of paper to the
molten metal, when if it takes fire, the temperature
is still too high; it should be allowed to cool until
the paper refuses to ignite, then and not till then
is the proper time for the addition of the mercury.</p>

<p>The copper conducting wires and binding screws
must be cleaned when they become much corroded;
if not they add resistance to the current, and it
will become considerably diminished, or cease altogether.
The cleaning may be effected by simply
annealing and then plunging them while still hot
into dilute sulphuric acid pickle, or dipping them
into nitric acid for about an instant.</p>

<p>The zincs should be taken from the battery liquids
when not required for use; and the porous cells
should be removed every night and their contents
poured into a large jug kept for the purpose. The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">» 155 «</a></span>
porous cells should be placed in clean water to
prevent the salts of the battery liquid from crystallizing
in the pores, which would crack and spoil
them for future use; the carbons should also be
placed in water; and when required for use again
these arrangements should be reversed, when the
battery will work as well as ever.</p>

<p>The solution for electro-plating articles of jewellery
is the next part of the subject we have to
consider, of which there are many, containing
various proportions of the metal employed in silver
depositing. The following is one of the best we
have employed: take pure silver and dissolve it in
a mixture of nitric acid and water:&mdash;</p>

<table summary="soln">
<tr>
  <td class="tdl">Fine silver</td>
  <td>5 dwts.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td class="tdl">Nitric acid</td>
  <td>4 drms.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td class="tdl">Water</td>
  <td>2 drms.</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>The silver should be put into a small Florence
flask, so as to allow the mixture of acid and water
to cover it thoroughly; this mixture on being added
to the metal soon promotes a chemical action, and
the silver becomes gradually dissolved. If the acid
employed has been weak, it will necessitate a further
addition of it to complete the dissolution of the
silver, or the removal of the flask to some other
and warmer place, such as a sand-bath, but care
should be taken not to apply too much heat. As
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">» 156 «</a></span>
the chemical action proceeds, red fumes are formed
in the flask; and the action should be allowed to
go on until these cease to rise, when the silver
should by that time have become dissolved. The
mixture then consists of a solution of nitrate of
silver, and should be carefully poured into a suitable
porcelain or Wedgwood capsule; this is then
heated upon a sand-bath until a scum or pellicle
appears upon the surface, when it should at once
be transferred from the sand-bath to a suitable
place for cooling. During the last operation the
mixture begins to form itself into crystals, and the
liquid which appears reluctant to crystallize should
be poured away from those already formed, into
another capsule, and again heated until it has
sufficiently evaporated to crystallize. When the
whole of the liquor has finally undergone this process,
the crystals of nitrate of silver must be
removed to another vessel, and about one pint
of cold water added, the whole being then well
stirred until they have become thoroughly dissolved.
A solution of cyanide of potassium is next prepared
in water, in the proportion of about one ounce of
cyanide to the pint of water; some of this solution
is then added to the one containing the nitrate of
silver. It must, however, be added very cautiously,
for precipitation soon takes place, and if too much
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">» 157 «</a></span>
be used, the precipitate becomes again dissolved.
For this reason it is advisable to take a little of the
solution from the vessel, in a wine-glass or test
tube, and to add a few drops of the prepared solution
of cyanide, in order to ascertain its exact state.
If the application of this solution produces no effect
upon the nitrate of silver, the operation of precipitation
is complete.</p>

<p>The liquid above the sediment should next be
carefully poured away to avoid any waste of
silver; when this is done fresh water should be
added, well stirred with the sediment, and allowed
to settle; it is then again poured off, and the process
repeated until the precipitate has become
thoroughly washed. Now add sufficient cyanide
of potassium to dissolve the precipitate and a little
more, and make up two quarts of solution with
fresh clean water. It is better to filter the solution
before using it.</p>

<p>The solution may be made by means of the battery,
and, if preferred, the above mode of chemically
preparing it may be dispensed with. The
following is the most simple method by the battery
process:&mdash;Dissolve in two quarts of water
about half an ounce, and no more, of best black
cyanide; this should be done in an oval, or still
better, oblong stoneware vessel, placed in an iron
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">» 158 «</a></span>
one of the same shape containing water. The
stone jar should not be allowed to touch the
bottom or sides of the iron one, a space being left
for holding the water. When the cyanide has
become dissolved, fill a porous cell with some of
the solution, place this cell in the other vessel
containing the cyanide; the solution should be
about the same height in both vessels. Now put
a piece of sheet copper, secured to the end of the
wire issuing from the zinc of the battery, into the
porous cell, and place in the larger vessel containing
the cyanide solution about one ounce of
sheet silver, properly secured to the wire issuing
from the carbon of the battery. In a short time
the solution in the larger vessel will have acquired
the right proportion of silver (5 dwts. to the two
quarts) for use; when this has been effected, the
porous cell should be removed and its contents
thrown away. These solutions are both worked
hot, at a temperature of not exceeding 120&deg; Fahr.
with the battery we have described.</p>

<p>The solutions are heated by means of gas-jets,
and the articles are plated by being suspended to
the wire proceeding from the zinc of the battery.
To the wire proceeding from the carbon is to be
attached the piece of sheet silver which dissolves
and keeps up the strength of the solution. The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">» 159 «</a></span>
piece of silver or anode being lowered into the
solution, upon the immersion of the work, an
almost instantaneous deposit of fine silver takes
place, the thickness of which depends entirely
upon the period of immersion.</p>

<p>When a solution begins to plate of an inferior
kind through the acquisition of organic matter, it
will be better to abandon it altogether and make a
new one, rather than to waste valuable time in
repeated attempts at improvement, which seldom
can be effected in solutions that have been employed
for all kinds of work. The silver may be
recovered from such solutions by means of the
battery, by precipitation, and by evaporation; the
first process, however, we have not always found
successful, the solution in some cases refusing to
give up its silver to the action of the battery. It is
put into operation as follows:&mdash;The anode which
supplies the solution with silver is replaced by one
of platinum, on which the cyanide solution has no
action whatever; a piece of clean sheet copper
should be hung upon the zinc wire of the battery,
and the battery kept in action until the whole of
the silver held in the solution has become deposited
upon it; at which stage it may be removed,
and the exhausted solution thrown into the waste
water tub. The piece of copper containing the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">» 160 «</a></span>
silver may be used again in the place of the silver
anode until it has become dissolved, or it may be
removed by any other means, if preferred. In the
event of the above plan failing, the process of
precipitation or evaporation should be resorted to.
If the former one be adopted, the solution should
be poured into a large open vessel, and considerably
diluted with water; sulphuric acid should
then be carefully poured in, a little at a time,
until it produces no effervescence. The sulphuric
acid precipitates the silver, and the fumes which it
creates are highly deleterious to health, therefore
the process ought to be performed in the open air,
and not in ill-ventilated workshops. When the
sulphuric acid produces no effect upon the solution,
it should be allowed to stand for a while for the
precipitate to subside, when the water above (which
should be clear) may be drawn off, the precipitate
well washed, to free it from the acid, dried, and
fused in a crucible with a little potash or soda. If
the latter plan be adopted, the solution may be
placed in a cast-iron kettle or saucepan, and then
heated upon a gas-jet or stove, until evaporation
takes place, after which the sediment should be
removed and fused in a crucible, as before.</p>

<span class="fig_caption">Fig. 40. Scratch-brush Lathe.</span>
</div>

<p>The finishing of silver work requires some little
knowledge and skill to perform it properly; and
we think that a few observations bearing upon it
will be of service to those for whom this manual is
written. After either of the processes of whitening
or plating, the work has to be scratched,
unless required to be left a <i>dead</i> white, then this
process does not take place; the scratching removes
from the surface the dull white colour
produced by the above processes, and effects a
characteristic bright and uniform colour to the
work of the silversmith. Scratching is done at
the lathe (<a href="#fig_40">Fig. 40</a>) by the application of a very fine
brass-wire brush of circular form
running upon the spindle; a
solution of weak ale runs from
a barrel with a tap to it, placed
upon the framework of the lathe
so as to enable the beer running
from it to fall upon the brush
during the whole time of its
rotary action, and this assists
the brush the more easily to
glide over the surface of the
work submitted to it. A large
quantity of silversmith&rsquo;s work
receives no other treatment than this, after the
whitening processes have taken place. Silver
chains are burnished by means of a polished steel
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">» 162 «</a></span>
jack chain, and the application of a little soft soap
and hot water, or otherwise scratch-brushed. The
beautiful frosted surfaces to be seen upon silver
lockets, and other work of a similar nature, are all
produced by means of the scratch-brush.</p>

<p>Burnishing is another mode of finishing silver
work. It produces a polished surface, which
reflects like a mirror, and gives the greatest
lustre: it removes marks left by the polishing
mixtures, and produces a darker surface than the
other modes of finishing. The tools employed for
this process are extremely variable, and well
adapted to the different kinds of work to which
they are applied; they are of two kinds, one being
formed of hard stone, and the other of polished
hardened steel; they vary with regard to shape,
some being straight with rounded points, or with
curved and blunted edges, others with large
rounded surfaces, &amp;c. Stone burnishers are
made of blood-stone, which is mounted in a
wooden handle with a brass ferrule, which firmly
secures the stone to it, in which state it is used.
Steel burnishers are likewise fixed in wooden
handles, which enable them to be firmly grasped
by the operator. Throughout the whole process of
burnishing, the tool should be repeatedly moistened
with a solution of soap and water; which causes it
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">» 163 «</a></span>
to glide more easily over the surface of the work,
prevents it from becoming too much heated, and
generally facilitates its action. In consequence of
the great friction which the burnishing tool undergoes,
it soon loses its bite, when it slips over the
work as if it were greasy; its effectiveness must
therefore be restored from time to time by rubbing
it upon the leather which the workman has beside
him for the purpose. It generally consists of a
piece of buff leather, impregnated with a little
crocus. In very small articles only steel burnishers
are used, as they are finer in make, and
by their greater variety of form, are exceedingly
well adapted to all kinds of work; in this class of
work, if any soap-suds should adhere to the article
they may be removed by the application of a little
tissue paper. Large pieces of work are rubbed
with a piece of old linen, or washed in a warm
solution of soap and water, rinsed, and dried in
boxwood sawdust, which finally completes the
process.</p>

<p>Silver work may be oxidized by any of the following
processes:&mdash;</p>

is to be entirely oxidized, it may be dipped for a
short time into the boiling mixture; if only in
parts, it may be applied with a camel-hair pencil,

<p>Reduce the salts to powder, and place it in a
black-lead crucible along with the acid, boil up,
and then dip the articles into the mixture for a
short time, or otherwise apply it to the parts
required to be oxidized.</p>

<p>These mixtures will give the various tints of
oxidation to silver work if properly treated; but if
other tints be desired, the following chemical substances
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">» 165 «</a></span>
may be employed according to taste:&mdash;For
slate-coloured surface, dip the articles into a boiling
solution of sulphuret of potassium. Strong
hydrosulphate of ammonia produces a dark tint of
oxidation, and if diluted with much water a light
tint is produced. Nitric acid produces a light surface.
The fumes of sulphur produce a beautiful
blue-coloured surface. This operation should be
conducted in a closed box, and all parts not to be
blackened should be coated with a suitable resist
varnish. After any of these processes the articles
may either be scratched, or otherwise burnished.</p>

<p class="caption3">Imitation Silver Alloys.</p>


<p>The undermentioned white alloys have their
various uses in the industrial and mechanical
arts, some being employed as common silver,
whilst others are manufactured as near as possible
in imitation of it, and used as a substitute,
for many purposes. In melting the alloys in which
nickel and several other compounds enter into combination,
unless very great care be exercised, it is
a difficult matter to maintain the true and definite
proportion of each metal of which the alloy proper
is composed, owing to the loss of the more fusible
metals by volatilization, if allowed to remain too
long in the furnace. The best method of preparing
the compound for the crucible, is to mix the copper
and nickel together. The latter is produced from
the pure oxide of nickel; therefore it is taken in
this form and placed in the crucible with the copper
at the commencement of the operation. When
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">» 167 «</a></span>
these ingredients are well melted, and incorporated
by stirring, add the zinc or other fusible metal
required to make up the compound, previously
heating it thoroughly over the mouth of the
<i>crucible</i>, to prevent the chilling of the already
molten metal which it contains. When silver
forms a component part in any of these alloys it
should be added at the beginning of the process
along with those of a high degree of fusibility, and
reduced under the protection of a suitable flux;
charcoal being the best for the purpose. This flux
also tends to preserve the fusible metals, upon their
addition to the melted compound in the pot, from
too suddenly flying away in the shape of fumes.
The best zinc of commerce should be employed
in these alloys, which is sold under the name of
spelter.</p>

<p>The platinum and palladium of which the last two
alloys are composed, although very difficult to use
in combination with any other metal, readily unite
in any proportions with silver; and it has been
found that such alloys are not so easily tarnished
as the ordinary ones, or even as fine silver itself.
These various alloys serve to effect the several
purposes for which they are employed in manufactures;
wires prepared from any of them will
supply the place of silver, as brooch tongs, stems
for pins, catches and joints, &amp;c. for articles of
common quality and cheap workmanship. They
are also employed for preparing the ground for
&ldquo;electro-plate,&rdquo; for which they are very serviceable.
When, however, these alloys are employed
by the regular silversmith, care should be taken
not to get the scraps of metal in any way mixed
with those of the better material, otherwise difficulties
will soon begin to present themselves,
which will materially interfere with the regular
and proper working of the best silver alloys; and
in fact, with all qualities that have originally been
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">» 174 «</a></span>
prepared free from nickel. Those prepared from
nickel are much more infusible than those made
without it; consequently, if a piece of the nickel
alloy, either by accident or design, gets intermixed
with the other quality, in a subsequent melting,
it will be found to float upon the surface of the
molten metal for some considerable time, and thus
retard the process. Alloys prepared in imitation
of silver are harder and much more difficult to
work than those of the true metal; therefore it
can easily be imagined what alteration the latter
undergo upon the addition of some of the former
compounds. The hardness and toughness which
these alloys possess admirably adapt them for such
purposes as we have described.</p>

<p class="caption3">Economical Processes.</p>


<p>In all silversmiths' establishments, the economical
or waste-saving processes, as they are termed,
require special and careful attention, so that the
actual working loss, or that portion of it which is
entirely irrecoverable by the manufacturer, may
be reduced to the lowest possible degree. It may
not be known to the general reader, or to the
beginner in the precious metal trades, that there
always takes place in the working up of the metal
a loss of material, a portion of which the manufacturer
is unable to recover, however cautious
may be the means employed for that purpose.
In the best regulated workshops, this loss will
amount at the lowest estimate to about 2&frac12; per
cent. of the whole quantity worked up in the
establishment. If the actual loss can be reduced
to within the above limit it is considered very
low, and highly satisfactory. Taking into consideration
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">» 176 «</a></span>
the loss that is occasioned in precious
metal working, and from calculations that we have
made from experience, we have long since arrived
at the conclusion, that it cannot possibly be estimated
under 10 per cent. of the total work daily
performed; and this opinion is based upon experiments,
the <i>raw</i> material being weighed before
the process of melting and after the articles were
completed, a fair calculation of course being made
for unfinished work. This was including every
description of manufacture; in some branches of
the trade the working loss is not quite so great,
but then there are others in which it is exceedingly
heavy, so that the estimated loss in the jewellery
trades cannot be safely put at a lower percentage
than we have quoted.</p>

<p>It will thus be seen that the <i>real</i> loss, such as
manufacturers are unable to recover by the means
already known to them, amounts to one-fourth part
of the total working loss of the establishment.
This is easily accounted for: in the first place,
a little takes place in the melting of the various
alloys, the re-melting of scrap metal, the reduction
of lemel, &amp;c.; then there are the sundry manipulations
of working; the passage of the metal
through various acids, and the processes of finishing,
each of which detaches small particles of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">» 177 «</a></span>
metal, too small to be visible to the naked eye,
but all of which go to form a portion of the loss
which the manufacturer never recovers. The unrecovered
metal may be judiciously proportioned
as follows:&mdash;A portion of it works itself into the
wood-work of the flooring of the shops, lathes,
boards, and other parts of workshop appliances;
then there is the refiner&rsquo;s profit&mdash;as purchases of
the sweep, polishings, and other refuse of precious
metal workers. Instances can be recorded in
which shrewd business-men have actually taken
up the floors of their workshops and recovered a
vast quantity of metal which was supposed to be
lost for ever; and instances are well remembered
in which two jewellers, upon removing into more
extensive premises, availed themselves of the
opportunity, not only of removing the boards which
formed the flooring of the premises they were
about to leave, but also those of the tenants they
were about to succeed. In one case, metal of the
value of &pound;80 was recovered, and in the other it
reached the large amount of &pound;150. The two
jewellers referred to, of course, were too un-English
to refund the proceeds to the late tenants, who,
when they became aware of it, if ever they did,
would be, no doubt, wiser if sadder men.</p>

<p>To prevent the precious metal from finding its
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">» 178 «</a></span>
way into such places as these, it is advisable to
have the floors well protected with sheet zinc or
iron, in which case not the least particle could be
lost in this manner. The extra cost of laying the
floors would soon be amply repaid, by an extra
quantity of the working loss being recovered; and
if other equally effective precautions were adopted
in the waste-saving processes by precious metal
workers, the <i>real</i> loss, which they cannot avoid
suffering, might even yet be reduced to the lowest
possible point. Iron or zinc covered floors may be
protected from wear, by laying over the surface
small square grates of perforated iron, and these,
being removable, may be readily taken up at
stated periods, for sweeping the refuse from the
floors; once a month will be found often enough
to do this. The gratings should, however, be
swept over lightly every day in order to remove
the dust and particles of metal that may accumulate
upon the surface into the perforations, and
also for the removal of waste paper and other
rubbish, continually accumulating in workshops.</p>

<p>Floors containing no such waste-saving precautions,
are commonly swept over once, and
sometimes twice each day, the refuse arising
therefrom being carefully passed through a very
fine sieve, all extraneous matter removed, and the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">» 179 «</a></span>
residue remaining in the sieve being well sorted
for the detection of all the precious metal visible
to the naked eye. The whole refuse matter is then
thoroughly burned in a muffle provided specially
for the purpose, and finally reduced to a fine
powder in a cast-iron mortar. When it has
reached this stage of the process, it is quite ready
for the particular kind of treatment it next receives
at the hands of the refiner. Grinding by large
stone rollers is now fast superseding this mode of
pulverising jewellers' waste and refuse. When
the latter plan is adopted, the refuse should be
swept from the floors every morning, carefully
looked through, and then transferred to a barrel
(having the top removed, which may be used as a
lid), where it can be well kept together, and hidden
from view until the time arrives for its further
treatment.</p>

<p>The waste which accumulates in the processes
of polishing, lapping, &amp;c., is greater than that
already referred to, consequently, it cannot be too
carefully looked after, in every stage, where a
large manufacturing trade is being carried on in
various branches. It is advisable in the practice
of true economy, for the polishing, lapping, and
scratching boxes to be repeatedly cleaned out,
and the contents removed out of the temptation of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">» 180 «</a></span>
every one, by being placed in a box, well lined
with either sheet lead or zinc, which ensures the
perfect safety of the material placed therein from
all irregularities in the workshop. This kind of
waste on being prepared for sale is again placed
in a very strong wrought-iron box, made of a suitable
size to fit the muffle, and having a thick close
lid to it. After the work of the day has been
completed, the fire in the furnace or muffle is made
up, the dampers are closed, and then the iron box
containing the refuse is at once passed in and
allowed to remain there till morning, when every
particle of matter will have become thoroughly
burned; a slight pulverization after this process
readily reduces it to a fine powder; further operations
then cease, and the product is in all probability
in a fine state of division, and fit for the
subsequent operations of the refiner and assayer,
whose special business it is to attend to these
arrangements of precious metal workers.</p>

<p>The next process we have to consider is one
which includes the whole of the liquid substances
variously employed in silver-working establishments,
such as the pickling solutions, washing-out
waters, whitening mixtures, and waste or spent
solutions of every kind. The whitening solutions
or mixtures, when in use, should be kept apart
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">» 181 «</a></span>
from the ordinary cleansing liquids, as after they
have been in use for a time, they become saturated
with copper taken off the work during the whitening
processes; if the solution is then set aside for
some time the copper eventually crystallizes out
from the liquor, which may be poured into the
waste-water tub, and the remaining crystals of
sulphate of copper, for such it then is, may be
removed and preserved.</p>

<p>In small establishments one large tub, to form
the receptacle for all spent or used-up liquids, will
be found sufficient; but in large places several will
be required. In the former case the water is only
drawn off at the beginning of every fresh week,
which allows plenty of time for the precipitation
of the silver without any disturbance taking place
in the mixture between the close of one week and
the commencement of another; whereas in large
concerns it requires to be drawn off continually
unless other vessels are provided for its reception
during a long period. Attempts have been made
to recover the silver from these solutions by simply
filtering the liquid through a coarse piece of felt
or flannel; or by providing a false bottom in the
tub or other vessel containing the waste waters,
arranged in the following manner:&mdash;A tolerably
large tub would be employed, being about one-fourth
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">» 182 «</a></span>
filled with coarse deal sawdust, next would
be placed the false bottom perforated with numerous
small holes, and upon this would be firmly secured
a piece of felt, so as to exactly fill up the space in
that part of the tub, which then serves to act as
the filterer of all solutions poured in above. The
liquid after passing through the piece of felt proceeds
through the perforations in the false bottom
into the sawdust beneath, where it is allowed to
run away by means of a small hole or tap at the
bottom. But the use of either of these processes,
if adopted on a large scale, where the waste
products amounted to some hundreds per annum,
would be wretchedly bad economy and tend to
a serious loss of valuable metal; the boiling
sulphuric acid, used in cleansing the work and for
other purposes, has the power of dissolving minute
particles of silver as well as those of the baser
metal which always enters into the composition
used in the production of the work of the silversmith;
therefore, that portion of the metal which
has become dissolved and entered into the chemical
state, requires to be brought back to its original
form before it can be saved by such means as
those just described. To illustrate this more
clearly, we will take the process of gold-colouring.
If workmen were to notice the rinsing waters
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">» 183 «</a></span>
employed in this process, subsequently allowing
the vessels containing the rinsing to stand for a
very short time, upon pouring away the surplus
water, a white curdy precipitate will at once be
observed at the bottom. This is the silver removed
from the surface of the gold alloy, which has been
precipitated by the muriatic acid and the common
salt employed in the colouring mixture, into the
form of <i>chloride of silver</i>. Now in this proceeding
there is no gold to be seen in any of the vessels,
but it is a well-known fact that a portion has
been removed during the process from the surface
of the gold articles. Where is it? Why, it has
become dissolved, and is therefore held invisible
in the solution, in consequence of the colouring
mixture forming the well-known solvent for gold,
<i>aqua-regia</i>. This is exactly the case with a portion
of silver in the silversmith&rsquo;s solutions; small
particles are continually being dissolved by the
mixtures employed, and are thus held in solution
past the power of filtering, unless some chemical
ingredient be added to it, which acts as a re-agent
upon the metal sought to be recovered. From
what we have seen in the colour water, which
always contains a little silver, it is evident that
both muriatic acid and common salt will do this
work for us. We prefer common salt, on account
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">» 184 «</a></span>
of its cheapness, besides being easily procurable.</p>

<p>The best mode of treatment for the silversmith&rsquo;s
waste waters, after being collected together by
pouring into the receptacle specially provided for
that purpose, is to prepare a saline solution for the
precipitation of the silver. This may be made by
mixing together common salt and tepid water, in
the following proportions:&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">
Common salt            3 oz.<br />
Tepid water            1 pt.<br />
</p>

<p>The water need only be sufficiently warm to
dissolve the salt, and the proportions given do not
require to be strictly adhered to; in fact any
quantity, if properly mixed, will do to effect the
purpose required, and we merely give these as a
guide for the process. In small establishments
where only one tub is employed, the above proportion
of saline solution may be added (every
Saturday after the completion of the day&rsquo;s work) to
the waste-water; the whole should then be stirred
slowly in a circular direction, and allowed to settle
until Monday morning, when all the surplus water
may be drawn off and poured away. In larger
establishments the accumulation of waste-water is
greater, therefore several collecting vessels should
be employed, and the mixture for precipitation
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">» 185 «</a></span>
may be added to them at other times than those
stated, if required, and in accordance with workshop
regulations. The sediment produced in the
collecting vessels after the supernatant water has
all been drawn off, may be removed, dried by heat
in a strong iron pan, and subsequently sold to the
refiner.</p>

<p class="caption3">Licences and Duties.</p>


<p>Manufacturing silversmiths, and all persons
trading in silver wares of more than five pennyweights
each, are compelled to take out a licence;
articles under that weight being exempt. The
licence has to be taken out annually, and costs
&pound;2 6<i>s.</i> for manufacturing or trading in articles
under thirty ounces in weight, and &pound;5 15<i>s.</i> for
articles of thirty ounces and upwards. It should
be taken out on the 6th day of July in each year
at the Excise Office. This Act of the Legislature
was passed in the year 1803, 43 George III. c. 69,
and is not the only one which refers to the subject
we are now considering. There are other conditions
besides the compulsory <i>Plate Licence</i>, as it
is called, to which manufacturing silversmiths are
subject, such as the supervision of the assay offices,
in the case of certain descriptions of goods; and
the payment of duty on all such goods. At the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">» 187 «</a></span>
present time all hall-marked silver articles have to
pay a duty of 1<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> per ounce, calculated not on
their gross weight, but on five-sixths of the weight,
the other sixth being allowed for waste in finishing
the articles, as they are sent to the Hall in a half-finished
state. The duty is paid at the Assay
Office at the time the goods are sent to be marked.
Some dissatisfaction just now exists in a portion of
the trade with regard to the above duty, as it is
considered excessive, besides having a tendency to
discourage the manufacture of silver wares; be
this as it may with respect to a certain description
of goods, on the bulk of the trade it can have no
injurious effect whatever. The duty is paid only
on manufactured <i>plate</i> and such other articles as
are requested to be hall-marked; besides which
the trade in this particular department of manufacture
has never been very extensive, being confined
to a few firms of eminence only.</p>

<p>Before going into the general details of this
question, it will be as well, perhaps, if we give a
short history of the imposts that have existed in
the silver trade for some time back. The first
impost that we can find recorded took the shape of
a <i>duty</i>, and was levied as far back as the year
1720, by 6 George I. c. 11, which placed a tax of
6<i>d.</i> per ounce on all silver plate manufactured in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">» 188 «</a></span>
Great Britain, which, should be assayed or marked.
The officers of the Excise were to collect the tax,
but the great difficulty of ascertaining the number
of ounces worked up, which the provisions of the
Act did not clearly set forth, soon rendered it
ineffectual, and it was consequently repealed by
the statute 31 George II. c. 32, and a licence then
substituted had to be taken out by manufacturers
and dealers in plate. The licence at this period
amounted to forty shillings, and had to be renewed
annually. In 1759, 32 George II. c. 14, it
was increased to &pound;5 per annum, for every person
trading in silver wares of thirty ounces and upwards;
wares in one piece not exceeding five
pennyweights in weight being exempted.</p>

<p>The next change that took place was in the
year 1784, 24 George III. c. 53, when a duty was
again imposed of 6<i>d.</i> per ounce on silver plate. It
was also enacted that the assay masters should
stamp the work with the additional mark of the
&ldquo;King&rsquo;s head,&rdquo; as well as the others already
ordered by the various Acts of the Legislature.
The mark of the King&rsquo;s head represented that of
the reigning sovereign, and showed that the duty
had been paid on the work. The present mark,
therefore, is the Queen&rsquo;s head.</p>

<p>By an Act passed in the year 1797, 37 George
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">» 189 «</a></span>
III. c. 90, the duty on silver ware was increased
to one shilling per ounce, but the Act which
subjected silver wares to a duty of 6<i>d.</i> per ounce
(24 George III. c. 53) has not been repealed, and
is therefore in existence to this very day; by its
provisions, however, the duty has been increased
from time to time, until it has reached the amount
at which it now stands.</p>

<p>The present annual licences of &pound;2 6<i>s.</i> and &pound;5 15<i>s.</i>
respectively, were enacted in the year 1803 by an
Act of 43 George III. c. 69, and by these regulations
every person making or trading in silver
wares, or otherwise dealing in the raw material,
is compelled to take out an annual licence, or
render himself liable to a penalty of &pound;50.</p>

<p>Another Act was passed in reference to the
duty on silver goods in the year following, 1804,
44 George III. c. 98, whereby it was increased
to 1<i>s.</i> 3<i>d.</i> per ounce. And in the year 1815, 55
George III. c. 185, the Act was further extended to
1<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> per oz. calculated in the manner we have
described at the beginning of this chapter. To
sum up, therefore, the silver <i>duties</i> in their several
forms, bearing upon the trade at the present time,
we find them as follows:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Manufacturers of silver wares under 5 dwts. in weights.&mdash;<i>Exempted
from all duties.</i></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">» 190 «</a></span></p>

<p>Vendors and dealers in silver wares under 5 dwts. in weight.&mdash;<i>Exempted
from all duties.</i></p>

<p>Manufacturers of silver wares under 30 oz. in weight.&mdash;<i>A plate
licence of &pound;2 6s. annually.</i></p>

<p>Vendors and dealers in silver wares under 30 oz. in weight.&mdash;<i>A
plate licence of &pound;2 6s. annually.</i></p>

<p>Manufacturers of silver wares of more than 30 oz. in weight.&mdash;<i>A
plate licence of &pound;5 15s. annually.</i></p>

<p>Vendors and dealers in silver wares of more than 30 oz. in weight.&mdash;<i>A
plate licence of &pound;5 15s. annually.</i></p>

<p>Bullion dealers, refiners, and assayers.&mdash;<i>A plate licence of &pound;5 15s.
annually.</i></p>

<p>Manufacturers of plate.&mdash;<i>A duty of 1s. 6d. per ounce.</i></p>

<p>Hall-marked goods.&mdash;<i>A duty of 1s. 6d. per ounce.</i></p></div>

<p>Manufactured plate includes silver wares, such as
spoons, forks, snuff-boxes, tea-sets, &amp;c., and other
articles used by the rich, and upon which the duty
is compulsory; the duty on hall-marked goods,
refers to all articles&mdash;with the exception of watch-cases,
which are free&mdash;marked at the request of
intended purchasers, which then pay duty on
the manufacture of them. It will be observed
from these remarks, that the silver trade generally
is not at all affected by the <i>duty tax</i>; the wares
manufactured by the trade at large not coming
directly under the compulsory provisions of the
law bearing upon this subject. It has been said
that the silver trade ministers to luxury, and no
doubt that portion of it which manufactures costly
articles of plate for the wealthy does so; but we
fail to see exactly, that the same remark applies
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">» 191 «</a></span>
to that vast and increasing commercial industry
which has sprung up of late years, and which bids
fair to become one of the staple trades of the
country. The duty-bearing articles are generally
purchased by the classes of society who can well
afford to pay the little extra which the duty imposes,
and as the tax affects only that section of
the silver trade which manufactures the article of
luxury, it is not at all likely that the general trade
would be increased by its entire removal. The
duty, no doubt to most persons, may seem excessive,
when calculated upon the percentage system;
such for instance, as a tax of 20 per cent. upon
spoons and forks; or one of 15 per cent. upon
chains; or of 12&frac12; per cent. upon tea-sets, &amp;c.;
this appears unjustly oppressive, and undoubtedly
affects the <i>silver-plate</i> manufacturer more vitally
than any one else.</p>

<p>To the ordinary silversmith this question of duty
is not likely to be of much importance; the agitation
therefore commenced against it, may be
expected to confine itself to those persons more
directly affected, and whose interests would be
advanced by its abolition.</p>

<p>The question of licences is one of far greater
importance to the trade generally than that of
duties, every manufacturer and dealer being compelled
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">» 192 «</a></span>
to procure a licence before he can carry
on his business. If more direct action were taken
in regard to this particular question, we believe
that the whole trade would enter into it; for it
resolves itself into this:&mdash;Why should the silversmith
or goldsmith pay for a licence for the
purpose of manufacturing and dealing, any more
than the coppersmith, or the manufacturer of
electro-plate, both of whom escape scot-free? We
believe this to be an unjust tax, and that it ought
not to be levied upon one particular trade any
more than another. We have also distinctions
made in the general class of silversmiths: we have
those who may trade without any licence at all;
those who may trade with a 46<i>s.</i> licence; and
those who may trade with 115<i>s.</i> licence, that is,
those who work or sell under 5 dwts., those who
work or sell under 30 oz., and those who work
or sell at any weight. Now this way of arranging
the matter is very unsatisfactory to the trade
generally; and any one of the first two traders
to whom we have referred, is liable at any moment
to be summoned before a criminal court for an
infringement of the law, if he should happen to
sell an article slightly over the weight for which
he is duly licensed. At the present time a raid
is being made upon the goldsmiths with reference
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">» 193 «</a></span>
to this particular question, and a number have
already been summoned for infringing their licences
in this manner. However, there appears to be
some doubt with respect to the Act of Parliament
bearing upon the subject, as in most of the cases
the defendants have gained a verdict, the line of
defence on their behalf being, that the clause of
the act which bore upon the cases referred to,
meant the weight in fine metal, <i>i.e.</i> &ldquo;pure gold,&rdquo;
of which the article was composed, and not that of
the gross weight of the article sold. It was urged
by those engaged in the various cases on the side of
the defendants, that, for a 46<i>s.</i> licence, the vendor
could sell an article in which the gold did not
exceed two ounces, without any regard to the
quality and weight made by alloy, and on this plea
the magistrates granted them a verdict. In the
higher courts we believe such verdicts would be
reversed, for we firmly believe that the framers
of the act meant no such thing, however defective
may have been the legality of the points raised.
The clause of the act to which we have alluded
is No. 5, and runs as follows:&mdash;"All articles sold,
or offered for sale, or taken in pawn, or delivered
out of pawn, and alleged to be composed wholly,
or in part, of gold or silver, are for the purposes
of the above act to be deemed to be composed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">» 194 «</a></span>
of gold or silver respectively; and if upon the
hearing of any information for any offence against
this act, any question shall arise touching the
<i>quantity</i> of gold or silver contained <i>in any article</i>,
the <i>proof of such quantity</i> shall be upon the defendant."
The Excise authorities argue that this
clause means that the absolute or gross weight of
an article sold as gold must not exceed two ounces,
and one sold as silver must not exceed thirty
ounces, gross weight. If this view of the meaning
of the act be eventually taken, and we believe
it will, it will certainly operate to a greater extent
against makers and vendors of gold articles than
it will against silversmiths.</p>

<p>That part of the <i>clause</i> referring to the quantity
of gold or silver contained in a given article, we
believe has reference to articles containing jewels,
&amp;c., in their construction, which renders it exceedingly
difficult to get at their exact weight, when
the work is finally completed with these jewels
properly affixed upon it, and not to the amount of
fine material any article may contain by assay.
The last part of the clause we have marked in
italics, &ldquo;proof of such quantity shall be upon the
defendant,&rdquo; fully bears out these observations,
because he is supposed to know the gross weight
of any special article before the addition to it of
any jewels.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">» 195 «</a></span></p>

<p>We have been led to make these few remarks,
in order to point out the gross anomalies which
exist in the trade with respect to these licences,
and to show the necessity of a reform taking place
in a trade singled out from all the others, and
made to pay a tax for the privilege of being
allowed to make, or sell, articles in which gold or
silver forms a component part. Therefore, if any
action is to be taken in the matter, it must not
be confined (if it is to be successful) to one particular
branch of this important trade, but all must
unite, and every influence should be brought to
bear upon it in as forcible a manner as possible.
The electro-plate manufacturer, and the dealer in
<i>his</i> wares, ought in all common fairness to the
trade, to be put upon the same footing as the silversmith,
if this licence is to be still continued. In
electro-plating establishments, thousands of ounces
of silver are being annually used on the surface
of such wares as are manufactured there; and if
such decisions as those lately given at the Thames
and other police courts, with reference to the Act
of Parliament on the subject of gold and silver
wares are upheld, we fail to see how the manufacturers
of silver-plated articles, who are continually
making and selling them, containing as
they do, more silver than the general public would
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">» 196 «</a></span>
suppose, are to escape much longer these new
interpretations of the Act of Parliament, and avoid
being called upon to take out a licence in the same
manner as the silversmiths. This is a tax in
which the holder gets no direct return, and is
levied in an unfair manner by the establishment
of various grades of silversmiths, so that it gives a
just cause for grievance. If the tax is to be
upheld at all, why not make it equal by the
establishment of one uniform rate for all trades
alike?</p>

<p>Copper, 1 oz.; nickel, 3 dwts. 12 grs; bismuth,
6 grs.; zinc, 2 dwts. 12 grs.; soft iron, 12 grs.;
tin, 12 grs. This compound is said to form a
fusible and malleable metal, that can be easily
worked by the silversmith; it is also said to resist
oxidation through atmospheric influences.</p>


<p class="caption3">Silver Wares.</p>

<p>Never scratch-brush silver ware with a solution
of soap and water; neither should it be washed
with the solution if it can be avoided, as it gives it
the colour of pewter; better to scratch in weak
ale, or if plain, rub it with a piece of wash-leather
and prepared chalk.</p>

<p class="caption3">Removing Gold from Silver Articles.</p>

<p>Silver articles which have been gilt, may be
brought back to their original colour, by simply
covering them with a thick solution of borax, and
then well annealing them. After this process if
the articles are boiled for a short time in one of the
whitening mixtures and scratched, they will present
a beautiful white and uniform surface.</p>


<p class="caption3">Oxidizing Silver.</p>

<p>A beautiful deep black colour, possessing great
lustre, may be given to finished silver work by
boiling it in the following preparation for some
time:&mdash;Bromine, 5 grs.; bromide of potassium,
5 dwts.; water, 10 oz. The boiling should be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">» 199 «</a></span>
effected in a stoneware pipkin, and generally
from two to five minutes will suffice for the
purpose. The work is finished after the proper
colour has been attained, by well rubbing with a
soft piece of wash-leather and a little best jeweller&rsquo;s
rouge. It is better to make the work as bright as
possible before submitting it to this mixture; for
this reason it is preferable to thoroughly buff all
plain surfaces on a piece of felt by the application
of the lathe, as by that means a characteristic
brightness is imparted.</p>


<p class="caption3">Dipping Mixture.</p>

<p>Brass or metal goods may be cleaned and their
oxides removed by dipping into the undermentioned
liquid for a few seconds only:&mdash;Oil of vitriol,
five parts; water, five parts; nitric acid, two and a
half parts; spirits of salts, two drachms. Well mix
the several ingredients together, and immerse the
work in the solution cold. The mixture improves
after a quantity of work has been dipped into it.</p>


<p class="caption3">Silver Powder for Copper.</p>

<p>Chloride of silver, two parts; cream-of-tartar,
two parts; alum, one part. Mix with water to
the consistence of a paste, and apply with a soft
leather or sponge; when sufficiently whitened,
well polish.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">» 200 «</a></span></p>


<p class="caption3">Powder for Silver.</p>

<p>Chloride of silver, 1 oz.; sal ammoniac, 2 oz.;
sandiver, 2 oz.; white vitriol, 2 oz.; bichloride
of mercury, 5 dwts. Make into a paste with water
and rub the articles over with it; then expose
them to a good heat upon a clear fire, in order to
run the silver and evaporate the mercury, after
which process dip in very weak sulphuric acid to
clean.</p>


<p class="caption3">To Protect the Polish of Metals.</p>

<p>Melt one part by weight of best wax paraffin
and when sufficiently cooled, add three parts of
petroleum. Well mix together, and apply to the
polished articles by means of a soft brush. The
protecting film is required to be only very thin,
therefore too much should not be put on.</p>


<p class="caption3">Silver Stripping Mixture.</p>

<p>Sulphuric acid, six parts; nitric acid, one part.
Take a large black-lead crucible or pipkin, and
heat the mixture in it; when this is done, put in
the work required to be stripped, occasionally
withdrawing it to ascertain the progress made.
The large proportion of sulphuric acid allows of
the dissolution of the silver, and does not sensibly
corrode or interfere with copper, or any of its
alloys, if kept quite free from water; therefore be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">» 201 «</a></span>
careful not to introduce wet articles into the mixture.
After finally withdrawing the work, it
should be well rinsed, annealed, and then boiled
out.</p>


<p class="caption3">Stripping Silver.</p>

<p>Put some strong oil of vitriol in a similar vessel
to those above described, apply heat, and during
the process add a few crystals of saltpetre. When
the solution has become hot enough the work
should be immersed in it, and be moved about or
agitated until the silver is dissolved from the
surface. The articles should not be allowed to
remain too long in the solution, and if it does not
remove the silver quickly, more saltpetre should
be added from time to time until the desired end
be attained.</p>


<p class="caption3">Soft Solder.</p>

<p>Pure tin, two parts; lead, one part. Melt and
well incorporate together; when this is done pour
into strips for use.</p>


<p class="caption3">Soldering Fluid.</p>

<p>Muriatic acid (spirits of salts), three parts; metallic
zinc, one part; or as much as the acid will
take up. When dissolved and all effervescence
ceases, allow it to settle, then decant the clear
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">» 202 «</a></span>
solution from the sediment at the bottom of the
vessel in which it has been made, and it is ready
for use. If a small quantity of water be added to
the mixture at this stage, say one-sixth, it will
answer quite as well for some purposes. For
soldering iron and steel, a very small portion of
sal ammoniac is of great advantage to the mixture
for promoting toughness.</p>

<p class="caption3">Resist Varnish.</p>

<p>Dissolve resin, or copal, in essence of turpentine,
or boiled linseed oil; to give it different shades of
colour, add red lead, chrome yellow, or Prussian
blue.</p>


<p class="caption3">Plate Powder.</p>

<p>Whitening, two parts, white oxide of tin, one
part, calcined hartshorn, one part. Reduce to a
powder and well mix together; apply as usual.</p>


<p class="caption3">Electro-plating Soft Solder.</p>

<p>Take nitric acid, 1 oz.; water, 2 oz.; copper
about 1 oz. in small flat pieces; when the copper
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">» 203 «</a></span>
has all dissolved and effervescence has ceased,
the solution is ready for use. To apply it, take
up a few drops by means of a camel-hair pencil
and apply it to the desired part, then touch it
with a bright piece of steel, and there will be
instantaneously a film of copper deposited. If the
copper has not spread all over the desired part, the
process should be repeated, when deposition in the
plating bath will take place with perfect success.</p>


<p class="caption3">Another Recipe.</p>

<p>Take sulphate of copper (that which accumulates
in the whitening mixture), one ounce; water, six
ounces. Reduce the sulphate of copper to a fine
powder and dissolve it in the water. Treat according
to the directions given in the previous one. A
good mixture for effecting the same result may be
made by dissolving verdigris in vinegar.</p>


<p class="caption3">Testing Silver Wares.</p>

<p>Take nitric acid, six ounces; water, two ounces;
bichromate of potash, one ounce. Reduce the salt
of potash to a powder and well mix it with the acid
and water. The solution is used cold, and should
be placed in a stoppered glass bottle, the stopper
having a long dropper extending into the mixture,
which acts as the agent for conveying the liquid
from the bottle to the article to be tested. The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">» 204 «</a></span>
surface of the article should be perfectly clean,
and to make certain what kind of metallic substance
you are testing, it is advisable to rub a file
over some obscure part of the surface and to apply
the liquid to that part. The test liquid should be
used, by means of the glass stopper, to the filed
part, and immediately removed by a sponge damped
with cold water. If the article consists of pure
silver, there will appear a clean blood-red mark,
which is less deep and lively in proportion to the
quality of the metal. Upon platinum the test
liquid has no action whatever; on German silver at
first a brown mark appears, but this is removed by
the sponge and cold water; on Britannia metal a
black mark is produced; and on all the various
metals an entirely different result takes place to
that on silver; therefore the test is a simple one,
and may be advantageously employed for the detection
of any fraud in relation to the precious metal.</p>


<p class="caption3">Another Test.</p>

<p>Water, 2 oz.; sulphuric acid, 2 drs.; chromate
of potash, 4 dwts. This mixture is applied in the
same way as before and produces a purple colour
of various depths, according to the quality of the
silver. No other metallic element exhibits the
same colour with this preparation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">» 205 «</a></span></p>


<p class="caption3">Perchloride of Iron.</p>

<p>Take spirits of salts, 8 oz.; crocus powder
(jeweller&rsquo;s polishing material), 1 oz.; well mix them
together and keep in solution. In preparing the
mixture for the dissolution of soft solder, &amp;c., take
1 oz. of it, and add to it 4 ozs. of boiling water.</p>

<p class="caption3">Removing Gold from Silver Wares.</p>

<p>Sometimes the process of annealing and boiling-out
fails to effect the removal of the gold from
articles which have been thickly gilt, in which case
the work should be submitted to the action of the
following chemical preparation:&mdash;Sulphuric acid,
6 ozs.; muriatic acid, 1 oz.; nitric acid, &frac12; oz. This
mixture should be heated in a black-lead crucible
or earthen vessel, and the work immersed until the
dissolution of the gold takes place, carefully watching
it during the progress of the operation. The
gold may also be removed by using a strong solution
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">» 206 «</a></span>
of oil of vitriol, to which has been added a fair
proportion of common salt.</p>


<p class="caption3">Silver Plating Fluid.</p>

<p>Nitrate of silver, 1 oz.; cyanide of potassium, 2
ozs.; water, 12 ozs. Put the cyanide and the nitrate
of silver into the water; shake them well together
until they become thoroughly dissolved, then let
the mixture stand till it becomes thoroughly clear.
It is then ready for use. If preferred, a little
prepared chalk may be used as an additional ingredient.</p>


<p class="caption3">Plate-cleaning Powder.</p>

<p>Take of the finest rouge, and prepared chalk,
equal parts, well mix and use dry by means of soft
leather.</p>


<p class="caption3">Solder for Aluminium.</p>

<p>Spelter, 18 dwts.; aluminium, 1 dwt. 6 grs.;

<p>In France, all articles manufactured as silver
are subject to <i>Government control</i> and pay duty,
but this is very slight compared with the English
duty, amounting only to one <i>franc</i> per <i>hectogramme</i>,
which is equal to about threepence per ounce.
This is exclusive of the charge for testing and
marking; the state of the articles sent for this
purpose with regard to the state of manufacture is,
moreover, very different from the custom in this
country. Here they are sent in their rough or
half-manufactured state, and this seems better
suited to the particular processes through which
they have to pass; whereas in France they may be
tested and marked in their whole or finished state;
and, if thought requisite, this operation may be
performed while the goods are on their way to
their final destination, by calling at the Control
Office for that purpose.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">» 209 «</a></span></p>

<p>The Continental silversmiths, especially the
French workmen, exhibit much ingenuity, original
thought, and refined taste, in the execution of their
work; and the natural capacity for design which
they possess enables them to produce articles of a
very high order and artistic character. The construction
of some of their productions is exceedingly
ornamental and decorative, and in some
instances this is even carried to excess, as may be
seen from some very elaborate articles which they
manufacture.</p>

<p>To them belongs the credit of being producers
of the most artistic and best decorative work in
the whole world. They set the <i>fashions</i> and work
them out with a will to be only found in a people
so enthusiastic as the French. Their jewellery is
very elegant, light, and showy; some of which is
prepared so thin as regards material, that it has to
be supported underneath by a wax composition,
which, however, gives increased strength to all
articles so manipulated. With regard to articles
of <i>vertu</i>, the French workmen certainly far excel
those of any other country: they are more original,
and bring into play greater ingenuity in the
various processes which they employ in their
manufactures. Still with all this ingenuity and
skill, their works of art in this department are not
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">» 210 «</a></span>
durable, being very <i>tinselfied</i>; in wear their shape
and form soon undergo a change, and eventually
they soon get destroyed. In this branch of art the
French workman might learn something to his
advantage from the English style of work, which is
the most durable of any nation in the world.
French silver plate and jewellery of the best
manufacture partake of the first standard; all
other kinds are of the lowest standard.</p>

<p>In Germany all silver manufactures are placed
under <i>Imperative</i> control, and lower standards than
those given in the table, under their respective
heads, cannot be worked. The German style is
similar to that of the French, but the former
manufacture an unusually large quantity of filigree
articles, very light in construction, tasteful, and
cheap; and the possession of these advantages
enables them to export to England and other
countries their wares at a cheap rate. They are
commonly sold by weight, and not so much per
article; in many cases the charge does not exceed
12<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> per ounce. In filigree work the Germans
cannot equal the taste and variety displayed in
Indian workmanship. In India the natives have
definite designs, but the Germans are too fond of a
variety of colours in their wares, which do not
always harmonize with their particular kind of work.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">» 211 «</a></span></p>

<p>In Austria silver manufactures are commonly
ornamented by enamel, niello, &amp;c., which gives
them a very pleasing appearance. They are
usually light and showy, and something after the
style of French work. The laws affecting the
Austrian silver workers are the same as those of
Germany.</p>

<p>The English style of work is strong and solid;
and is undoubtedly superior to that of all Continental
manufacturers as regards substantial workmanship,
careful manipulation, and durability.
It is, moreover, capable of a higher finish, and
possesses more evenness of surface, together with a
combination of strength, that admirably suits it
for articles and utensils for daily use, and which
causes it to be preferred before that of any other
nation; and while France, Germany, and other
countries may exhibit greater ingenuity, to England
belongs the credit of producing the best
<i>finished</i> and the most <i>durable</i> work of any nation in
the world.</p>
